Response:

[[ ## reasoning ## ]]
The pronoun "he" in the sentence "The sniper shot the terrorist because he was a bad guy" is most likely referring to "the terrorist." The phrase "because he was a bad guy" provides a reason for the sniper's action, suggesting that the terrorist is the one being described as a "bad guy," which is why the sniper shot him.
