451,"agent 0: Hello! Do you like paramedics in the healthcare profession? That's my job.
agent 1: Wow. I honestly believe that is one of the most important and best jobs someone can do. To go out there at high speed and pressure knowing someone's job is on the line.
agent 0: I agree! Another important job is being in politics. Hilary Clinton is a great example.
agent 1: Yea. That's fair and I honestly believe that she would have been a much better president than Donald Trump.
agent 0: I agree! Trump is too caught up in his own businesses and running Trump Tower.
agent 1: Yea and he has the personality of someone who should be running a prison not the country. He is too racist to be running a diverse country like america,
agent 0: I totally agree. Maybe he should go to the Republic of Colombia instead.
agent 1: Yea, him and Pablo are pretty much the same in terms of personality although one was a drug dealer and the other a misogynist.

454,"agent 0: I love to watch American football, also known as gridiron.
agent 1: I have never really understood the sport that well, but I know the basics.
agent 0: It's not hard to get. The offense, or the team controlling the ball, attempts to advance down the field by running with and passing the ball while the defense tries to stop them.
agent 1: I get that part, but when others yell, boo, hiss, and curse at a play that was made, I don't get it. I also don't know what a safety is.
agent 0: Honestly, do we really need to know much other than whoever has the most points at the end wins? You will get the yelling, booing and cursing because people get very involved.

agent 0: Yeah, association football. Sorry, I should have specified! He's someone that started way back in 1994. He had good form all the way throughout, and that led him to get an international call-up in 1998, leading him to get signed for the Serie A defending champions, Juventus.
agent 1: Oh okay! I couldn't recall the name association football! Thierry Henry sounds like quite an amazing player! Is he still playing?
agent 0: No.. in fact, he's a French association football coach now! And he was--in both 2003 and 2004, he as the runner-up for FIFA World Player of the Year, so that gives you an idea of his skill. Also won two league titles and three FA Cups. Partly why I like him is I'm part French, and he represented us well at the international level, and is our leading goalscorer, too.
agent 1: Holy moly! He's very accomplished! I bet he makes for a fantastic coach!
agent 0: I agree with you.. He was mentored by the great Arsène Wenger, who made him somewhat of a prolific striker (which is someone whose primary mission is to score), and so that set him up to be able to be Arsenal's all-time leading scorer with 228 goals in all the competitions he played in.
agent 1: That's an impressive number! I'll bet many players look up to him. What else can you tell me about Thierry Henry?
agent 0: While he was runner-up in some accolades, he did get awarded PFA Players' Player of the Year twice, and the FWA Footballer of the year three times. So, he was respected by his peers.

agent 1: I always found it amazing how the body works. And they're still learning new things all the time.
agent 0: Very true, and luckily in most countries, a neurosurgeon has to have at least 7 more years of training, even after medical school. So, at least it gives one some confidence in their ability.
agent 1: no kidding. It took me 4 years just to learn accounting. One has to be pretty darn smart to get into science...
agent 0: That's true. But, think about a lobotomy! Due to all the dangerous serious side effects, that would be dang scary to me!
agent 1: I watched a documentary called the lobotomist and it was fascinating. They honestly thought it was a cure all for mental illness. Shows how much we know...
agent 0: Yes, and even though some consider it a part of neurosurgery, it has been very controversial from it's beginning, and I can see why!",0,0,"The dialogue is about neurosurgery and the agents are discussing their thoughts and knowledge about it.
