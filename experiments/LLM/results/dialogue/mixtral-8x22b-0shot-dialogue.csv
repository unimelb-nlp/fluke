agent 0: Wow! That sounds amazing. I'll have to try one sometime. I went to New Zealand a few years ago and instead of buns, they just use white bread for theirs.
agent 1: In Atlanta they had a kiosk for Street Food that had special foot long buns that were U shaped.  They were awesome
agent 0: Have you heard of the new Texas Rangers' ""pickle dog?""
agent 1: No, what is a Pickle Dog?  New kind of Street Food?
agent 0: It's a hot dog in a pickle and then fried like a corn dog. It's a bit excessive if you ask me, but it's gone viral.
agent 1: Yeah I've tried it before they are delicious I have them every time I go to the festival.
agent 0: Yeah but it's a bit mundane, nothing really interesting about it, its just kind of blame.",1,1
240,"agent 0: oh no. why are you upset?
agent 1: the neighbor attracts mice with their garbage. and he has cats!
agent 0: Hmm, then perhaps you should get a cat too? I have one in my tiny house, it keeps critters away!
agent 1: I can't. I'm allergic, and even if I wasn't I don't like cats. Or any dirty animals. Should we call pest control?
agent 0: Have you seen any mice indoors? If not then baited traps should do the trick
agent 1: No, not indoors yet. I'll try. I don't know how you can stay so calm? I'm about ready to get in my car and leave.
agent 0: I suppose it's the serious, responsible lawyer-to-be in me that stays calm in any situation. Plus, they're not inside!
agent 1: Yet! Haha. You're right, I'm getting overly worried due to my phobias, but it's just so hard to stay calm. I might go and work on my car to relax
agent 0: I think you should take a walk so you can calm down
agent 1: I think I'll do just that. I may get a cat on my way back. Good thing I am not allergic",1,1
241,"agent 0: Hi, do you have any advice on how to stay motived?
agent 1: For me Motivation is a word that is part of the popular culture as few other psychological concepts are, so you have to find your own ways to motivate yourself
agent 0: Hmm, okay I see what you mean. What do you do to stay motivated when you have to do a rather mundane task?
agent 1: Motivation as a desire to perform an action that you rather not, so you need to find the reason why, and hopefully change your mind:D
agent 0: Ahh I see, so if I find a suitable reason why I should do a task I will find motivation easier. That sounds good to me.:)
agent 1: The ""wanting behavior"" associated with a rewarding stimulus can be increased by microinjections of dopamine, so you need to be happy to be motivated also:D
agent 0: Well I think it's ridiculous to try to talk myself into something by making up reasons. I don't agree with your reasoning at all.",1,1

agent 0: Yes the Psalms are beautiful. Myself and my wife like reading Psalms before bed for peace of mind.
agent 1: I agree - they've always brought me comfort.  Reading in general before bed does for me.  I recently strayed away some though from the Lord
agent 0: We all stray, but by going back to the good book we can find ourselves again.
agent 1: Yeah, that's my goal.  I recently had a mid life crisis and changed my hair blue - I'm thinking of returning to my natural roots.
agent 0: Yes, you should return to your natural color as that is the way our Lord would like it.

agent 0: It is so much easier to loarn something young. Same with sports and other things. Much harder later in life.
agent 1: Agreed.  However, I made the most advancement later than usual when learning to read.  It was very hard for me.
agent 0: Why do you think that was?
agent 1: I had a learning disability that was mild enough to go unnoticed for several years in elementary school.
agent 0: I have heard from a lot of people that they have experienced that. Did you get good help when it was noticed?
agent 1: Yes, in the 5th grade I had an amazing teacher that noticed the problem and helped me.  At the time, I read on about a 1st grade level.

252,"agent 0: Have you ever owned one? Is there any risks to owning one that you know of?
agent 1: I've never owned one. There are a few risks, as some of them are not exactly ""pet-friendly,"" since they have antipredator adaptations, things like venom, and reflex bleeding, along with other non-painful tactics like camouflage and being able to sacrifice their own tails and regrow them to escape!

agent 0: Well it has happened a couple times in my life. The pain wasn't so severe as to cause physical damage, as happens in ""broken heart syndrome"".
agent 1: Oh wow people actually suffer physical damage?
agent 0: Yes, the heart can have trouble doing it's job of supplying blood, oxygen, and nutrients adequately - I guess it is from the depression and anxiety that often accompanies the state of mind.

This year,  I decided I kinda had enough and would just stay put,  even though the apartment was just so-so. Do you like it well enough even if the neighbors may give you trouble?

agent 1: I love accounting,  is versatile
agent 0: I agree. It's often been called the language of business. It can measure the results of an organization's economic activity and relay it to other users.
agent 1: No organization can do without an accountant.
agent 0: For sure. Organizations can divide accounting into several fields according to what they need, such as financial or management accounting, external auditing, etc.
agent 1: What are the differences?

agent 0: I agree! Another important job is being in politics. Hilary Clinton is a great example.
agent 1: Yea. That's fair and I honestly believe that she would have been a much better president than Donald Trump.
agent 0: I agree! Trump is too caught up in his own businesses and running Trump Tower.
agent 1: Yea and he has the personality of someone who should be running a prison not the country. He is too racist to be running a diverse country like america,
agent 0: I totally agree. Maybe he should go to the Republic of Colombia instead.
agent 1: Yea, him and Pablo are pretty much the same in terms of personality although one was a drug dealer and the other a misogynist.

agent 0: I have some investments in mutual funds, but not in individual shares.
agent 1: Do you find that you get a pretty good return?
agent 0: It depends on various factors, but I find that the holding period is most important. You have to be able to stick it out through economic swings.
agent 1: Do you find it discouraging when the market drops or do you feel confident that you will be okay?
agent 0: Unless you're talking about an enormous and sustained downturn, most of the time if you wait long enough you will recover, so I tend to be optimistic that will occur. The market is volatile by nature, you have to be patient.
agent 1: So would you recommend that people invest if they have a little bit of expendable income?
agent 0: Absolutely! Many funds now allow small investments, and so long as you don't try the high risk funds, making a little profit will usually encourage you to invest more.",0,0
454,"agent 0: I love to watch American football, also known as gridiron.
agent 1: I have never really understood the sport that well, but I know the basics.
agent 0: It's not hard to get. The offense, or the team controlling the ball, attempts to advance down the field by running with and passing the ball while the defense tries to stop them.
agent 1: I get that part, but when others yell, boo, hiss, and curse at a play that was made, I don't get it. I also don't know what a safety is.
agent 0: Honestly, do we really need to know much other than whoever has the most points at the end wins? You will get the yelling, booing and cursing because people get very involved.

agent 0: Yeah, for sure. My least favorite shade would have to be olive green. I had a really ugly chair that color when I was growing up. What shade do you think is the worst?

agent 1: Oh really? I've recently gotten into American football, but I think you're talking about soccer? Is that right?
agent 0: Yeah, association football. Sorry, I should have specified! He's someone that started way back in 1994. He had good form all the way throughout, and that led him to get an international call-up in 1998, leading him to get signed for the Serie A defending champions, Juventus.
agent 1: Oh okay! I couldn't recall the name association football! Thierry Henry sounds like quite an amazing player! Is he still playing?
agent 0: No.. in fact, he's a French association football coach now! And he was--in both 2003 and 2004, he as the runner-up for FIFA World Player of the Year, so that gives you an idea of his skill. Also won two league titles and three FA Cups. Partly why I like him is I'm part French, and he represented us well at the international level, and is our leading goalscorer, too.
agent 1: Holy moly! He's very accomplished! I bet he makes for a fantastic coach!
agent 0: I agree with you.. He was mentored by the great Arsène Wenger, who made him somewhat of a prolific striker (which is someone whose primary mission is to score), and so that set him up to be able to be Arsenal's all-time leading scorer with 228 goals in all the competitions he played in.
agent 1: That's an impressive number! I'll bet many players look up to him. What else can you tell me about Thierry Henry?
agent 0: While he was runner-up in some accolades, he did get awarded PFA Players' Player of the Year twice, and the FWA Footballer of the year three times. So, he was respected by his peers. Always a good sign. Guess that's why he made a natural transition to coach.",0,0

agent 0: It's like physical and mental pain that you feel after losing such an important relationship. It won't go away.
agent 1: That sounds painful. What can be done about it?

agent 1: Did he have a weapon?
agent 0: I couldn't tell if he had a weapon. I'm always assuming everyone has weapon its kind of a sad society these days
agent 1: I think it is very important that our young people do not see this type of stuff.

agent 0: In bowling a perfect score is 300, and it's almost impossible to do.
agent 1: Wow! To achieve a score of 300 it means that you have 12 strikes in a row. Have you ever achieved this score?

agent 1: well its considered social housing now.. its an umbrella term referring to rental housing which may be owned and managed by the state, by non-profit organizations, or by a combination of the two
agent 0: I see, that's interesting. It's good that those things exist for people who need it.
agent 1: I know a woman who was actually paid 6 dollars per month to live in an apartment. That's free rent and one pack of cigarettes.
agent 0: I guess so. Better than having someone homeless on the streets, especially compared to the amount of money we give billionaires for free.
agent 1: True. If that guy that invented Tesla cars would give up half a billion, it'd help quite a bit.
agent 0: Sure. Do you think it's weird how much of most people's income goes to paying rent?
agent 1: I find renting as strange as typing with both hands. I type with one, and am starting to believe perhaps I'm in the minority on both accounts.
agent 0: I think you might be right about that. Can you type fast when typing with only one hand?
agent 1: 20 words per minute if it's not too cold in the office. 30 words per minute if my blood is warm. Summer is the superior season.

agent 0: Yes, and a lot of people do not know how dangerous it can be.  Not just the normal wear and tear, but injuries can be pretty bad
agent 1: Chearleading is very strenuous. Especially now that it also considered a competitive sport in itself. Routines range from one to three minutes. The routines contain lots of tumbling and jumps.
agent 0: One of the major reasons of injuries is from stunting, otherwise known as the pyramid
agent 1: That is a difficult move. I love how in 1997 Cheerleading became an international competition. It was even aired on ESPN.

agent 1: Yes, a lush green yard, the green leaves on a summer day in the park. Definitely beautiful! Some think of green as a lucky color, heard of that?
agent 0: The plants are that color due to the chemical they use during photosynthesis called chlorophyll. I think green is a very lucky color.
agent 1: It's sometimes amazing to me that the process of photosynthesis can produce such a color in plants! But, I prefer that green color over the dead brown when they die!
agent 0: Absolutely! Plants need the chlorophyll in order to absorb energy from light, or they will die.

agent 1: I never have but I heard his books have been translated into 42 languages, I think he's a popular author.
agent 0: Wow, that's a lot of languages to translate a book in. I believe his books are suspenseful and involve law related stories since his background is a lawyer.

agent 1: Yes, a lush green yard, the green leaves on a summer day in the park. Definitely beautiful! Some think of green as a lucky color, heard of that?
agent 0: The plants are that color due to the chemical they use during photosynthesis called chlorophyll. I think green is a very lucky color.
agent 1: It's sometimes amazing to me that the process of photosynthesis can produce such a color in plants! But, I prefer that green color over the dead brown when they die!

agent 1: His character is really interesting. I didn't like him at first but I grew to understand him and respect the intricacies of his character.
agent 0: Yes Grimes' character suffered a lot, especially when he lost his wife during childbirth. He is the glue that holds the show together.
agent 1: That part was pretty terrible. It was shocking to me that they would even keep a baby during a zombie apocalypse!
agent 0: It sure created a lot of difficulties for them. Baby Judith is now older so it should be easier for them. Walking Dead is popular for 18 to 49 year old viewers",0,0

agent 1: I am actually not a fan of hunting. I eat animals, but I would feel bad about killing them.
agent 0: Well not all hunting is about killing you can usually just trap the animal, or track them with the intent of doing so. And then release them.
agent 1: But isn't that really cruel? They have no idea what is happening and don't know that you won't hurt them.
agent 0: Well most hunters like to use a special device to remotely catch an animal like an electronically controlled cage trap. People trap them not to be cruel but to relocate them somewhere else.
agent 1: Ok, fair enough. As long as there is some reason behind it that doesnt harm the animal then that is ok.
agent 0: Indeed, I never condone animal cruelty, And if I take a shot I always do it right and make it an instant death, the meat is never wasted, We eat all of it.",0,0

There were kids of different ages,  and one of the kids (8 years old or so) was picking on the littler kids.

agent 0: Yeah,  I was pretty amazed in the moment,  he was flat as a board in mid air before he landed flat on his face. I had to watch for a moment in awe,  before I realized he was getting up and I was about to get smacked. So,  I ran towards where the parents were seated,  stopped when I turned the corner,  and walked calmly over to my mom,  taking a seat on her lap.

agent 1: Impressive! I do like doing crossword puzzles with pen and paper but I find it easier now to do them on my phone or tablet.
agent 0: They are okay on the phone but it just doesn't feel the same as the ones on paper. It's like an e-reader vs a book. Which do you prefer?

agent 1: Well,  often people just give up and relegate themselves to just sitting in a chair and watching TV. Even if you have to force yourself,  at least you are forcing yourself.

agent 0: Well the first match of american football was played november 1869 between two college teams under rules of the association of football, so i can say america has been pretty serious about football for a while but i am not sure about pro football starting here.Canda has a professional football team as well.

agent 0: I agree! Do you think the show has diminished over time though? Not as great as the original series.
agent 1: All things do with time, but it really took off in the third season when it attracted the 18 to 49 demographic.
agent 0: Yeah. Everyone was honestly into it during that time. It's nowhere near as prevalent nowadays sadly. Have you ever tried playing the Walking Dead games?
agent 1: I never played it but I am aware it was an episodic choice based game.
agent 0: Yes! That is correct. They are excellent, although much like the real show dropped off in quality over time. Very emotional and worth trying them. They are cheap.",0,0

agent 1: No I haven't. I wanted to because it is very popular. Just never found the time.
agent 0: I've tried but could never really get into it - it starts with the main character waking up from a coma and realizing the world is overrun by zombies.
agent 1: Post apocalyptic horror. I like sci fi movies and this is on cable so it's fairly easy to catch if you want to watch it.
agent 0: I should be completely interested in it - I mean it's filmed right here in Atlanta - I even have friends that have run into the actors just around town.
agent 1: Yeah you should, I like that one actor Reebus something. He's pretty cool.
agent 0: Yeah maybe I'll give it another go - it has attracted the most 18-49 year old viewers of any cable or broadcast tv series - all those people can't be wrong.
agent 1: There is even a show about the show. that comes on after each episode I believe.

agent 1: Well if you consider that historically it's used for hunting and combat, people have been shot with arrows - I mean look at Hawkeye!  He's the ultimate archery master!
agent 0: That is true. Archery was around long before guns were invented. It used to be the most lethal weapon around!

agent 0: Oh wow! I can't imagine what people had to go through before brain surgery was invented! When was it invented, by the way?
agent 1: I'm not sure, but you need at least seven years after graduating from med school of training.
agent 0: Oh wow! I figured as much! That was the one major thing preventing me from going to school for it!
agent 1: I understand, here in the US, one has to do 4 years of unergrad education, 4 years of med school and 7 years for residency!

agent 0: I agree. The offense, which is the team controlling, has to charge into the opponents head first!
agent 1: yeah they do! Do you prefer offence or defence
agent 0: I prefer offense since the feeling when you get to the end zone for a touchdown is so good.
agent 1: it must feel good it's so hard!

agent 1: Yes, I have. A few times. Do you know when that phrase was coined?
agent 0: It's hard to tell exactly, but it has been referenced for at least 3000 years. Impressive if you ask me
agent 1: Yes, very. Do you know who made that phrase?
agent 0: I actually don't know. I don't think anyone knows. But a broken heart can actually cause physical damage to the heart called ""broken heart syndrome""
agent 1: Wow! I never knew that before. I have heard of people dying from a broken heart, but never knew it was for real.
agent 0: It's really crazy, but it's believed to be part of a survival instinct. Losing someone can be a matter of life or death, quite literally.
agent 1: Yes. I have heard of older people who's spouses died and then they died a short time later.
agent 0: It's horrible. But the reason we feel the pain is to try to encourage humans to stay in close relationships when possible.",0,0

agent 0: Exactly! Pizza is another favorite food, so many different choices
agent 1: Yeah, my kids love pizza, I like to make it myself rather than order it, at least then I can save some money
agent 0: That is a good idea. I make shrimp scampi pizza and it is so good. Never seen it in a restaurant though
agent 1: I love scampi, I live in New York so its certainly not traditional to put on pizza around here, I might give it a try. Sounds Delicious!
agent 0: Try it! The trick is to thicken the sauce that you cook the shrimp in (with flour) and then spread on the dough
agent 1: Interesting, is it just a normal tomato sauce you cook them in, or is it something else?
agent 0: No, just butter and some lemon juice
agent 1: Interesting, is this a recipe from your grandmother, or is it something you got from elsewhere?",0,0

agent 0: They attempt to take the ball to the touchdown but running or throwing it.
agent 1: Sounds interesting. How many players are on the offense?
agent 0: Similar to a soccer team, 11 players. They have to go atleast ten yards from where the ball starts to get a first down.
agent 1: Wow, I didn't know. When does football start each year?
agent 0: It starts usually in the fall. It's an interesting game because while they have to play as a unit, each player has a different task.
agent 1: What does the defense do?

agent 1: Yes and I know points are scored by getting the ball into the other teams endzone to touchdown then everyone cheers and drinks!
agent 0: That's definitely the most exciting way to score, for sure. And yes, brewskis are an important part of all sports. It's half the reason I watch, to be able to drink, lol.

agent 0: I usually use a lighter ball but I hear using a heavier one has a higher accuracy. Is that true?
agent 1: The accuracy of the bowling ball really boils down to practice and using the same ball over and over again.
agent 0: Ah yes thats what I thought. Do you know how a person can go pro? is it difficult, I am assuming you need to hold a very high score to be eligible.
agent 1: You would have to start out playing in local leagues and then move your way up. You would have to do very well, because it is one of the major throwing sports and is very competitive.

agent 1: i just recently went bowling on a date, and I think my score was closer to 80!! Are there any effective strategies to get better at bowling?
agent 0: It certainly depends on the type of bowling game you are playing. Some varieties include target bowling, ten-pin, nine-pin and duckpin. I think the best advice is to keep your arm straight.
agent 1: Oh my, I didn't realize there were so many different types of bowling games. What is the most popular bowling game?
agent 0: Ten-pin is the most popular, and it is what you played on your bowling date. Most bowling games descend from a European lawn game called Skittles though!
agent 1: Skittles, as in the candy skittles, oh goodness! What did that game consist of?
agent 0: So I think it consists of throwing a baton at some pins and the max score is 50. People still play it in the United Kingdom and Ireland, but I have never played it.
agent 1: What is the highest score a person can get in regular ten-pin bowling?
agent 0: A perfect score is 300. It is my life dream to bowl a 300 one day, but I doubt I'll ever be able to do it.",1,0

agent 1: I can see how it can be frustrating. I dont know if I could kill a duck though. Ducks can be annoying but I dont like killing anything unless its an insect spider or snake.
agent 0: Well honestly the snake or spider is probably more beneficial to the ecosystem then a duck honestly. The duck and geese populations are very well managed and controlled through hunting. There are a lot more benefits then not to hunting waterfowl.

agent 1: Don't do it!  You'll increase your risk for heart attack so quickly!  You're doing great!  There's definitely a psychology to eating meat.  Vry complex combination of morality, emotions, congnition, and personality but research nutrition and you can make the right choice.

agent 1: I'm not sure of the exact origins, but I read somewhere that the dish was recorded in a medieval English cookbook in the 14th century!
agent 0: Was it as popular as it is now?
agent 1: Actually not! It used to be called ""makerouns"" though I""m not sure why.
agent 0: That's funny...maybe it was the type of cheese that they used.
agent 1: I read that it was made with fresh hand-cut pasta and then slathered with butter and cheese. So it sounds exactly like what we make today!
agent 0: Do you know what kind of cheese they used? Like usually we use cheddar now.
agent 1: I don't, but whatever it was I bet it was delicious. Imagine how it was just from the same cow
agent 0: Back then they could of made it with goat milk, but whatever animal they milked it was definitely fresh? And the pasta...I love fresh pasta.
agent 1: Yeah! And pasta dates back to the 4th century B.C.!
agent 0: Have you ever made fresh macaroni and cheese?
agent 1: I haven't, but maybe I'll give it a try!
agent 0: It's much better then the boxed stuff...it's not too hard either.

agent 1: Not only that, it has a long tradition as the color of ireland culture as well!
agent 0: I agree!  But the real important question is, are green apples better than red?

agent 1: I definitely need to learn how to take care of cars.
agent 0: I've been doing it since I was little.  It was something my father showed me.
agent 1: With all the road trips I take with my animals It would be a valuable trade to learn!

agent 0: I liked it when he awakens from a coma to find the world that he new is now overrun by zombies.
agent 1: Zombies are pretty terrifying. Would you agree?

agent 0: It really is. Although the scope of what you do can vary widely across the globe, the paraprofession in the US just recently came around in the 1970s, which most people don't know.
agent 1: I did not know that! What all does your daily job entail?
agent 0: It varies widely. But it's a role that finds itself closely related to other healthcare positions, especially EMS roles, where you have a higher grade role, which is to say you'll be granted both more responsibility and autonomy.
agent 1: Oh wow, that is impressive. Do you plan on doing this for the rest of your career?
agent 0: We will see. I may be moving, so it could change things, as there are different models of care for EMS providers given the area they're in, and those different models can influence the scope of practice they can do in an area.
agent 1: That is understandable. That seems like a career that has job opportunities anywhere, though.

agent 1: Well. The US government won't say anything, but I have come across some interesting leads in a small Russian newspaper, which lead my investigation to a library in Kabul.
agent 0: Wow!  Dealing with different countries would definitely add a degree of difficulty.  Is it strange the US government won't (or can't) say anything?  That sounds very odd

agent 1: I love Irish coffee.  You need Irish whiskey, sugar and thick cream.
agent 0: Also, coffee!: )
agent 1: Yea, coffee too. You are not supposed to use whipped cream but modern recipes do so.
agent 0: I don't use whipped cream when I have it. I don't want the extra calories, and I just want to get down to business with the whiskey and coffee! Ha!
agent 1: Originally, it was served to a group of very cold American passengers from a boat.  The restaurent owner soothed them by poring whiskey into their coffee.  So he did not use cream either
agent 0: Oh, that's interesting. It's a soothing thing to drink when you're really cold. I think some people use brown sugar in it.
agent 1: Yes, some recipes specify brown sugar.
agent 0: To me the main thing is that the coffee needs to be really hot. Sometimes I pour hot water in the mug first, to get the mug really hot. Bailey's Irish Cream is a pretty good variation instead of regular whiskey.",0,0

agent 1: Children can be a driving distraction.
agent 0: Yes, they can be very distracting. My 2 daughters are very noisy as they anger me.
agent 1: That's why the summer is brutal because they are always around. By September it's time for school and no more entertaining them.
agent 0: Oh yes! However, the drive to school is no fun. Just makes me more angry when my daughters argue with each other.

2974,"agent 0: I love to go hunting, I usually hunt as a means of pest control.Because I have foxes who eat my chickens all the time.
agent 1: I am actually not a fan of hunting. I eat animals, but I would feel bad about killing them.
agent 0: Well not all hunting is about killing you can usually just trap the animal, or track them with the intent of doing so. And then release them.
agent 1: But isn't that really cruel? They have no idea what is happening and don't know that you won't hurt them.
agent 0: Well most hunters like to use a special device to remotely catch an animal like an electronically controlled cage trap. People trap them not to be cruel but to relocate them somewhere else.
agent 1: Ok, fair enough. As long as there is some reason behind it that doesnt harm the animal then that is ok.
agent 0: Indeed, I never condone animal cruelty, And if I take a shot I always do it right and make it an instant death, the meat is never wasted, We eat all of it.

agent 0: I like that it can be used as just simple transportation or as a recreational activity.
agent 1: Is it scary?
agent 0: No I think it is fun. You just have to get used to using it as a mode of transport. Modern skiing has evolved from its beginnings in Scandinavia.
agent 1: I think it would be weird sliding down a hill with something strapped to my feet.  I guess in Scandinavia, skiing would be much easier than trying to walk.

agent 1: I've never heard of a Goldendoodle!  Do they make good pets?
agent 0: Yes! Golden retrievers are considered great family dogs, so they were chosen to be cross-bred with poodles

agent 0: The first Goldendoodle was bred in 1969 by Monica Dickens
agent 1: They haven't been around all that long!  Are they easy to train?
agent 0: Yes, they were initially created in order to create guide dogs for people with allergies
agent 1: I think I'll see if I can find a local breeder - I might just want to get one for myself!
agent 0: You should! Although many goldendoodles don't have the same hypo-allergenic coat as poodles, many goldendoodles have a low to non-shedding coat

agent 1: Well in the United Kingdom, the paramedic is now a health profession that requires an individual license to practice medicine.
agent 0: I think it's important to hold a seperate license for it as it's a very specific branch of medicine that involves a higher degree of intuitive thinking.

agent 0: Well long time ago, early skiers would use 1 long pole or spear instead of 2 like you see today.

agent 0: Modern skiing came from Scandinavia, but it was thought to originally come from China, as seen in ancient paintings. Who would've thought.
agent 1: That makes sense. Maybe my Scandinavian ancestry is why I'm ok at skiing. Not downhill, though, only cross country. Do you think genetics has much to do with skiing abilities?

3610,"agent 0: I've always been in love with American football, since a kid. It's a fairly simple game, a team sport, 11 players on each side, with goalposts at the end of the 100-yard field. Easy to get into!
agent 1: I've never seen a game, but my husband loves football! I don't know much about the sport! How do you score points?
agent 0: The offense scores it, by either running or passing the ball, and they have four chances to advance it 10 yards, or they lose control. The points come mostly by moving the ball into the other team's end-zone, or kicking the ball through the opponent's goalposts!
agent 1: Oh! I think I get it! Does each player have a different role to play on the team? Do some kick and some block?
agent 0: Essentially, yes! There are those who block for the quarterback, who throws the ball to the wide receivers to catch it, or he can give it to the running back to carry it. And the defense has both those to rush the quarterback and to guard the receivers. Interestingly, this all started from evolving from rugby football!
agent 1: Oh really?! Is the US the only country to have this style of football?
agent 0: No, they share this style with Canada, as well, who have their own professional league. Although there are some slight differences between the two.

agent 0: That sounds like fun!
agent 1: Yeah there is nothing like getting some chores done during the day and then unwinding with a bottle of wine in the evening!

agent 0: He only has one day to spend with his daughters.  Not enough time at all
agent 1: That is terrible. Maybe he needs some help to resolve the situation in court.
agent 0: I try to help him when I can by watching the girls, but living in a condo does provide much enterainment.

agent 0: Yes and several network television appearances which helped his career take off.

agent 1: I am working today, Monday morning, the start of a new week.
agent 0: Since I work from home, I make my own hours most of the time. Sometimes I work all weekend. It depends how I feel.
agent 1: That sounds like a nice balance. Do you enjoy your own work?
agent 0: The work is a little monotonous, but I am glad I am able to continue to work from home despite being bed ridden.
agent 1: That is a major advantage of working from home.

agent 0: I always liked to bowl but was never very good at it, I am good at Wii bowling lol!!
agent 1: Does Wii bowling have the maximum score of 300 or some other score?

agent 1: I like football too, but am a bit rusty with all the rules.  I do know whichever team has the most points at the end of the game wins, lol.
agent 0: Ha! That's about the extent of my knowledge! Do you know how long the NFL has been around?
agent 1: I know history a bit better than the rules.  I believe the first game of American football took place in 1869.  It was a college game.
agent 0: That's news to me! I had no idea college football came before the NFL. Do you know how many teams are currently in the NFL?
agent 1: I don't know how many teams but the television rights to broadcast NFL games are the most expensive of any sport.

3886,"agent 0: I love to watch American football, also known as gridiron.
agent 1: I have never really understood the sport that well, but I know the basics.
agent 0: It's not hard to get. The offense, or the team controlling the ball, attempts to advance down the field by running with and passing the ball while the defense tries to stop them.
agent 1: I get that part, but when others yell, boo, hiss, and curse at a play that was made, I don't get it. I also don't know what a safety is.
agent 0: Honestly, do we really need to know much other than whoever has the most points at the end wins? You will get the yelling, booing and cursing because people get very involved.
agent 1: So, are you saying that the technicalities of the sport are not important?
agent 0: I honestly don't think so, not to me. I more enjoy just getting together with people, watching the teams I like play, and rejoicing when they win.
agent 1: I see, that's basically what I do. But I do feel left out when I'm unable to contribute to the conversation.
agent 0: Well next time, just mention that American football has been around since 1869, then you will seem knowledgable!",0,0

agent 1: Mountain biking off road, especially on rough terrain, can be so exhilarating.
agent 0: Yes it is! It really makes me feel alive. I love speeding down hills and seeing how fast I can go!
agent 1: Have you done freeriding? It's similar to mountain biking, but you mostly go downhill and work on jumping and tricks and such.
agent 0: No I haven't tried that at all. I haven't done any sort of trick biking. I think it would be pretty cool though.
agent 1: Have you been to British Columbia? Biking is really popular there.
agent 0: Not yet but I actually was planning a trip there this summer. I guess I can check out the biking scene first hand!
agent 1: The pacific northwest is such a nice place to visit. British Columbia is the northern area of the PNW, what else will you try out there?

3889,"agent 0: Do you know how to speak in Japanese? I always have found it interesting but have never taken any formal schooling or lessons
agent 1: Yes, you should learn. It's easy because it has simple phonotactics, and a pure vowel system.
agent 0: Oh okay I see. So its much less complicated then learning English or Spanish? I took 3 years of Spanish and can only say as many phrases as I can count with my two hands. Its challenging to learn a new languege
agent 1: Yes, Japanese is somewhat similar to English because a lot of their words have English roots.
agent 0: Oh okay, doesnt the language look like pictures on paper rather then letters like English?
agent 1: Yes, and word order goes from subject to object to verb.
agent 0: Okay well it sounds like something I can learn easily. I was able to learn Spanish very quickly.",1,0

agent 1: Yes! And the first match was played in 1869 between 2 college teams.
agent 0: Wow I didn't realize how far back the sport went.

agent 0: That is so true. I'll find someone one day. I'm in no rush
agent 1: That's a really good philosophy. I feel like a lot of people have this idea that they HAVE to find someone as soon as possib;e
agent 0: Then they wonder why their relationships are toxic. Some people are crazy
agent 1: Yeah, my mom was a social worker and she saw a lot of teens who got into toxic relationships because they rushed it
agent 0: You can't love someone else until you love yourself
agent 1: That's true
agent 0: More people need to realize that and quit looking for fairytale ending
agent 1: I agree. Plus the idea that there's the ""perfect person"" out there is just false. No one's perfect, but if you love them, you'll work through issues together

agent 1: The accuracy of the bowling ball really boils down to practice and using the same ball over and over again.

agent 1: You would have to start out playing in local leagues and then move your way up. You would have to do very well, because it is one of the major throwing sports and is very competitive.

agent 0: Calling is the hardest thing to master. Everything else is pretty easy. Ive been a few times. It can be really fun, and really frustrating at the same time
agent 1: I can see how it can be frustrating. I dont know if I could kill a duck though. Ducks can be annoying but I dont like killing anything unless its an insect spider or snake.
agent 0: Well honestly the snake or spider is probably more beneficial to the ecosystem then a duck honestly. The duck and geese populations are very well managed and controlled through hunting. There are a lot more benefits then not to hunting waterfowl.
