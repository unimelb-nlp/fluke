0,The sniper shot the terrorist because he was a bad guy.,he,"0: The sniper, 1: the terrorist, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and logic of the sentence:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" is the reason for the sniper's action.
2. The phrase ""because he was a bad guy"" is used to justify the sniper's action.
3. In this context, ""bad guy"" is more likely to refer to the terrorist than the sniper.
4. It wouldn't make sense for the sniper to shoot the terrorist because the sniper himself was a bad guy.
5. The logical interpretation is that the terrorist was shot because the terrorist was a bad guy.

Therefore, ""he"" most likely refers to the terrorist.",1,1
1,The sniper shot the terrorist because he had orders.,he,"0: The sniper, 1: the terrorist, 2: Neither","To determine who ""he"" refers to in this sentence, we need to consider the context and logical flow of the statement.

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" is the reason for the sniper's action.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is followed by ""had orders,"" which implies a command or instruction.
3. In a military or law enforcement context, it's typically the sniper who would receive and act on orders, not the target (terrorist).
4. It wouldn't make sense for the terrorist to have orders that caused the sniper to shoot him.

Therefore, the most logical interpretation is that ""he"" refers to the sniper. The sniper shot the terrorist because the sniper had orders to do so.",0,0
2,The chimpanzee could not use Linux because it was an animal.,it,"0: The chimpanzee, 1: Linux, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. The pronoun ""it"" is used in the latter part of the sentence.
2. The sentence states that ""it was an animal.""
3. Between the two candidates, only ""The chimpanzee"" is an animal.
4. Linux is an operating system, not an animal.

Therefore, the pronoun ""it"" must refer to ""The chimpanzee"" because it is the only candidate that fits the description of being an animal.",0,0
3,The chimpanzee could not use Linux because it uses different commands than Windows.,it,"0: The chimpanzee, 1: Linux, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""it"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence has two main parts:
   - ""The chimpanzee could not use Linux""
   - ""because it uses different commands than Windows""

2. The pronoun ""it"" is used in the second part of the sentence.

3. Logically, the subject that ""uses different commands than Windows"" would be an operating system, not an animal.

4. Linux is an operating system, while a chimpanzee is an animal.

5. It makes more sense for Linux to use different commands than Windows, rather than a chimpanzee using different commands.

Therefore, the pronoun ""it"" most likely refers to Linux, not the chimpanzee.",1,1
4,Bill punched Bob in the face because he was being rude to Mary.,he,"0: Bill, 1: Bob, 2: Neither","To determine who ""he"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and logical flow:

1. The sentence states that ""Bill punched Bob in the face.""
2. The reason given for this action is ""because he was being rude to Mary.""
3. The pronoun ""he"" is more likely to refer to the person who was punched (Bob) rather than the person doing the punching (Bill).
4. It's more logical that Bill punched Bob because Bob was being rude to Mary, rather than Bill punching Bob because Bill himself was being rude to Mary.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Bob (candidate 1).",1,1
5,Bill punched Bob in the face because he wanted to protect Mary.,he,"0: Bill, 1: Bob, 2: Neither","To determine who ""he"" refers to in this sentence, we need to consider the context and logical flow of the action described.

1. The sentence states that ""Bill punched Bob in the face.""
2. The reason given for this action is ""because he wanted to protect Mary.""

Given this information, it's more likely that ""he"" refers to Bill for the following reasons:

1. Bill is the subject of the main action (punching), which makes him the primary actor in the sentence.
2. The desire to protect Mary is presented as the motivation for the punching action.
3. It would be illogical for Bob, who was punched, to be the one wanting to protect Mary in this context.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Bill, as he is the one who took action (punching) with the motivation of protecting Mary.",0,0
6,"Carl borrowed a book from Richard, but the book was never returned to him.",him,"0: Carl, 1: Richard, 2: Neither","To determine who the pronoun ""him"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. Carl borrowed a book from Richard.
2. The book was never returned to ""him"".

In this case, ""him"" most likely refers to Richard because:
- Richard is the one who lent the book to Carl.
- It would make sense that the book should be returned to the person who originally owned it or lent it.
- If ""him"" referred to Carl, it would imply that Carl borrowed the book from Richard and then didn't return it to himself, which doesn't make logical sense.

Therefore, the pronoun ""him"" most likely refers to Richard.",1,1
7,"Carl borrowed a book from Richard, but the book was unreadable to him.",him,"0: Carl, 1: Richard, 2: Neither","To determine who ""him"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context:

1. Carl borrowed a book from Richard.
2. The book was unreadable to ""him"".

The pronoun ""him"" is more likely to refer to Carl for the following reasons:

1. Carl is the subject of the sentence and the main actor (he borrowed the book).
2. It's more logical that the person who borrowed the book would be the one trying to read it.
3. If the book was unreadable to Richard, it wouldn't make sense for him to lend it in the first place.

Therefore, the most reasonable interpretation is that Carl borrowed the book, but found it unreadable when he tried to read it.",0,0
8,Bill likes to play with Bob because he loves playing.,he,"0: Bill, 1: Bob, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence states ""Bill likes to play with Bob because he loves playing.""
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause explaining why Bill likes to play with Bob.
3. The most logical interpretation is that ""he"" refers to Bill, as it's explaining Bill's motivation for playing with Bob.
4. If ""he"" referred to Bob, the sentence would be less coherent, as it wouldn't explain why Bill likes to play with Bob.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Bill.",0,0
9,Bill likes to play with Bob but he did not want to.,he,"0: Bill, 1: Bob, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Bill likes to play with Bob"".
2. The second part of the sentence uses ""but"" to introduce a contrasting idea: ""but he did not want to"".
3. The pronoun ""he"" is used to refer back to one of the previously mentioned individuals.
4. Given the structure of the sentence, it's more likely that ""he"" refers to Bob, not Bill.
5. This is because the sentence implies that Bill likes to play with Bob, but Bob (the object of the first clause) did not want to play.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Bob.",1,1
10,The salesperson told Dave that this would be the best car he ever bought.,he,"0: The salesperson, 1: Dave, 2: Neither","To determine who the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence is about a conversation between a salesperson and Dave.
2. The salesperson is telling Dave something about a car.
3. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the phrase ""he ever bought.""

Given this context, it's more logical that ""he"" refers to Dave rather than the salesperson. The sentence is describing Dave's potential experience with the car (i.e., it being the best car he ever bought), not the salesperson's experience. It wouldn't make sense for the salesperson to be referring to themselves when talking about buying the car.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Dave.",1,1
11,The salesperson told Dave that this would be the best car he ever sold.,he,"0: The salesperson, 1: Dave, 2: Neither","To determine who the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The subject of the main clause is ""The salesperson"".
2. ""Dave"" is the indirect object of the verb ""told"".
3. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the subordinate clause ""he ever sold"".

Given this structure, ""he"" is more likely to refer to ""The salesperson"" because:

a) ""The salesperson"" is the main subject of the sentence and thus the most prominent entity.
b) The act of selling a car is typically associated with a salesperson, not a customer.
c) If ""he"" referred to Dave, it would imply that Dave was selling the car, which doesn't make sense in the context of a salesperson telling Dave about the car.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to ""The salesperson"".",0,0
12,The student wanted to ask the professor for help but decided not to because he was too scared.,he,"0: The student, 1: the professor, 2: Neither","To determine who the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and logic of the sentence:

1. The sentence describes two people: the student and the professor.
2. The main action is that the student wanted to ask the professor for help.
3. The sentence then states that ""he"" decided not to ask for help because ""he"" was too scared.

Logically, it makes more sense that the student would be the one who is scared, not the professor. The professor isn't taking any action in this sentence; they are merely the potential recipient of the student's question. The fear is what's preventing the action of asking for help, and since the student is the one who wanted to ask for help, it's most likely that the student is the one who is scared.

Therefore, ""he"" in this context most likely refers to the student.",0,0
13,The student wanted to ask the professor for help but decided not to because he was too intimidating.,he,"0: The student, 1: the professor, 2: Neither","To determine who the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and logic of the sentence:

1. The sentence describes a situation where the student wanted to ask the professor for help.
2. The student decided not to ask for help.
3. The reason given is that ""he was too intimidating.""

Logically, it makes more sense for the professor to be described as intimidating rather than the student. The student's decision not to ask for help is based on their perception of the professor. It would be unusual for a student to decide not to ask for help because they themselves were too intimidating.

Therefore, ""he"" in this context most likely refers to the professor.",1,1
14,The student couldn't understand the teacher because he had an accent.,he,"0: The student, 1: the teacher, 2: Neither","To determine who ""he"" refers to in this sentence, we need to consider the context and logical implications:

1. The sentence states that the student couldn't understand the teacher.
2. The reason given is that ""he had an accent.""
3. Having an accent is typically a characteristic of the speaker, not the listener.
4. In this case, the teacher is the one speaking (teaching), and the student is listening.
5. Therefore, it's more logical that the accent belongs to the teacher, as this would explain why the student couldn't understand him.

Based on this reasoning, ""he"" most likely refers to the teacher.",1,1
15,The student couldn't understand the teacher because he wasn't paying attention.,he,"0: The student, 1: the teacher, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and logic of the sentence:

1. The sentence states that the student couldn't understand the teacher.
2. The reason given is that ""he wasn't paying attention.""
3. Logically, the one who wasn't paying attention is more likely to be the student, not the teacher.
4. It's the student's lack of attention that would cause them not to understand the teacher, rather than the teacher's lack of attention causing the student not to understand.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to the student.",0,0
16,The campers turned on their flashlights because it was dark without them.,them,"0: The campers, 1: their flashlights, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. ""The campers turned on their flashlights"" - This establishes that the campers have flashlights.
2. ""because it was dark without them"" - This is the key part for determining what ""them"" refers to.

The pronoun ""them"" in this context is referring to something that, when absent, makes it dark. Logically, this would be the flashlights, not the campers. If we remove the campers from the scenario, it wouldn't necessarily become dark. However, if we remove the flashlights, it would indeed be dark.

Therefore, ""them"" is referring to ""their flashlights"" in this sentence.",1,1
17,The campers turned on their flashlights because the darkness scared them.,them,"0: The campers, 1: their flashlights, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""them"" refers to, let's analyze the sentence:

""The campers turned on their flashlights because the darkness scared them.""

1. ""The campers"" (candidate 0) is the subject of the sentence and the main actors.
2. ""Their flashlights"" (candidate 1) is an object being used by the campers.
3. The pronoun ""them"" is used at the end of the sentence in relation to who or what was scared by the darkness.

Logically, flashlights cannot be scared, as they are inanimate objects. The only entities in this sentence capable of feeling fear are the campers. Therefore, ""them"" must refer to ""the campers.""",0,0
18,Francis stopped and looked at the penguin because he was intrigued.,he,"0: Francis, 1: the penguin, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence has two subjects: Francis and the penguin.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""because he was intrigued.""
3. The verb ""was intrigued"" suggests a state of mind or emotion, which is more likely to be attributed to a person rather than an animal.
4. Francis is the main subject of the sentence and the one performing the actions (stopping and looking).
5. It's more logical and natural for Francis to be intrigued by the penguin, rather than the penguin being intrigued by Francis.

Based on these points, it's most likely that ""he"" refers to Francis. The sentence is describing Francis's actions and his reason for looking at the penguin (because he was intrigued by it).",0,0
19,Francis stopped and looked at the penguin because he was cute.,he,"0: Francis, 1: the penguin, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine whether the pronoun ""he"" refers to Francis or the penguin. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" is the reason Francis stopped and looked at the penguin.
2. The adjective ""cute"" is more likely to be used to describe a penguin than a person named Francis.
3. It's more natural to say that Francis stopped to look at the penguin because the penguin was cute, rather than Francis stopping because Francis himself was cute.

Based on these observations, it's most logical to conclude that ""he"" refers to the penguin. The penguin's cuteness is the reason Francis stopped to look at it.",1,1
20,The off-campus apartments were preferred to the on-campus apartments because they were cheaper.,they,"0: The off-campus apartments, 1: the on-campus apartments, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence compares two types of apartments: off-campus and on-campus.
2. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the latter part of the sentence to describe a characteristic (being cheaper) of one of these apartment types.
3. The sentence states that the off-campus apartments were preferred because ""they were cheaper.""
4. Logically, the pronoun ""they"" must refer to the off-campus apartments, as these are the ones being described as cheaper and therefore preferred.

The pronoun ""they"" clearly refers to ""The off-campus apartments"" in this context.",0,0
21,The off-campus apartments were preferred to the on-campus apartments because they were more expensive.,they,"0: The off-campus apartments, 1: the on-campus apartments, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and logic:

1. The sentence compares off-campus apartments to on-campus apartments.
2. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the latter part of the sentence to describe why one type of apartment was preferred.
3. The sentence states that one type was preferred ""because they were more expensive.""
4. Logically, people usually prefer less expensive options, not more expensive ones.
5. Therefore, ""they"" must refer to the apartments that were not preferred.

The sentence states that off-campus apartments were preferred, so ""they"" must refer to the on-campus apartments, which were not preferred due to being more expensive.",1,1
22,The general fired his pistol at the monster so he could be a distraction.,he,"0: The general, 1: the monster, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and logic of the sentence:

1. The sentence describes two entities: the general and the monster.
2. The action of firing a pistol is performed by the general.
3. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""so he could be a distraction.""
4. Logically, the one who would want to be a distraction is the one who initiated the action - in this case, the general.
5. It makes more sense for the general to intentionally create a distraction by firing his pistol, rather than the monster being a distraction.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to the general, as he is the one who fired the pistol with the intention of being a distraction.",0,0
23,The general fired his pistol at the monster so he turned and looked.,he,"0: The general, 1: the monster, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence describes two actions: 
   - The general firing his pistol at the monster
   - Someone turning and looking

2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the second part of the sentence, indicating that it refers to the subject of the second action (turning and looking).

3. Logically, it makes more sense for the monster to turn and look after being fired upon, rather than the general turning and looking after firing his own pistol.

4. The sentence structure suggests a cause-and-effect relationship: the general fired his pistol, so (as a result) someone turned and looked.

Based on these points, it is most likely that ""he"" refers to the monster, as the monster would be the one to react to being fired upon by turning and looking.",1,1
24,Liverpool lost to Manchester United because they had been mismanaged all season.,they,"0: Liverpool, 1: Manchester United, 2: Neither","The pronoun ""they"" in this sentence refers to Liverpool. The context suggests that the reason for Liverpool's loss to Manchester United is that ""they"" (Liverpool) had been mismanaged all season. It wouldn't make sense for ""they"" to refer to Manchester United in this context, as the mismanagement is presented as the reason for Liverpool's loss, not Manchester United's victory.",0,0
25,Liverpool lost to Manchester United because they were a superior team.,they,"0: Liverpool, 1: Manchester United, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" refers to Manchester United. The context suggests that the reason Liverpool lost to Manchester United is because ""they"" (referring to Manchester United) were a superior team. It's more logical to describe the winning team as superior, rather than the losing team.",1,1
26,"Rice beat Texas, even though they were a smaller school.",they,"0: Rice, 1: Texas, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" refers to Rice. The context suggests that Rice, despite being a smaller school, managed to beat Texas. The phrase ""even though they were a smaller school"" provides additional information about Rice, indicating that Rice is the subject being referred to by ""they"". This makes sense because it emphasizes the unexpected nature of Rice's victory over Texas, given their smaller size.",0,0
27,"Rice beat Texas, even though they were the best team in the nation.",they,"0: Rice, 1: Texas, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" most likely refers to Texas. The context suggests that Texas was considered ""the best team in the nation,"" yet Rice still managed to beat them. This interpretation makes the most sense because:

1. It's more common for a team to be considered ""the best in the nation"" before a game, rather than after losing.
2. The phrase ""even though"" indicates a contrast or surprise, implying that Rice's victory was unexpected because they were playing against a highly-ranked team.
3. If ""they"" referred to Rice, it wouldn't make sense to say ""Rice beat Texas, even though Rice were the best team in the nation"" as this wouldn't be a logical contrast.

Therefore, ""they"" most likely refers to Texas in this context.",1,1
28,The state executes prisoners because they want justice.,they,"0: The state, 1: prisoners, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. ""The state executes prisoners"" is the main clause of the sentence.
2. ""because they want justice"" is a subordinate clause explaining the reason for the main action.

The pronoun ""they"" is more likely to refer to ""The state"" for the following reasons:

1. ""The state"" is the subject of the main clause and the primary actor in the sentence.
2. It's more logical for the state to want justice as a motivation for executing prisoners, rather than the prisoners themselves wanting justice as a reason for their own execution.
3. Grammatically, ""they"" is plural, which can refer to collective nouns like ""the state"" (representing a group of people or an institution).

While ""prisoners"" is also plural and could technically be referred to by ""they,"" it doesn't make logical sense in this context for prisoners to want justice as a reason for their own execution.

Therefore, the most likely referent for ""they"" is ""The state.""",0,
29,The state executes prisoners because they were convicted of heinous crimes.,they,"0: The state, 1: prisoners, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. ""The state executes prisoners"" - This is the main clause of the sentence.
2. ""because they were convicted of heinous crimes"" - This is a subordinate clause explaining the reason for the execution.

The pronoun ""they"" is used in the subordinate clause to refer to the subject of the conviction. Logically, it's the prisoners who are convicted of crimes, not the state. The state is the entity carrying out the execution, while the prisoners are the ones being executed due to their convictions.

Therefore, ""they"" must refer to the prisoners, as they are the ones who were convicted of heinous crimes.",1,1
30,"Jason built Rocky a robot, and he gave it to him.",he,"0: Jason, 1: Rocky, 2: Neither","To determine who ""he"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and the actions described:

1. Jason is the subject of the first clause, performing the action of building a robot for Rocky.
2. The second clause states that ""he gave it to him.""
3. The pronoun ""he"" is the subject of the second clause, performing the action of giving.
4. It makes more sense that the person who built the robot (Jason) would be the one giving it to Rocky.
5. If ""he"" referred to Rocky, the sentence would imply that Rocky gave the robot to himself, which is less logical in this context.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Jason, as he is the one who built the robot and would logically be the one to give it to Rocky.",0,0
31,"Jason built Rocky a robot, so he had more free time.",he,"0: Jason, 1: Rocky, 2: Neither","To determine who ""he"" refers to in this sentence, we need to consider the context and logical flow of the statement.

1. Jason is the subject of the first clause, performing the action of building a robot for Rocky.
2. The second clause, ""so he had more free time,"" is a result of the action in the first clause.
3. Logically, the person who would have more free time as a result of building a robot would be Rocky, not Jason.
4. Jason, by building the robot, likely spent time and effort, which wouldn't result in him having more free time.
5. Rocky, on the other hand, would benefit from having a robot to help with tasks, thus gaining more free time.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Rocky, as he is the one who would logically have more free time as a result of Jason building him a robot.",1,1
32,My heart pumps blood because it is liquid.,it,"0: My heart, 1: blood, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""it"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. ""My heart pumps blood"" is the main clause of the sentence.
2. ""because it is liquid"" is a subordinate clause explaining why the heart pumps blood.

The pronoun ""it"" in this context refers to ""blood"" for the following reasons:
1. ""It"" is used to describe something that is liquid.
2. Blood is a liquid, while the heart is a solid organ.
3. The sentence is explaining why the heart pumps blood, and the liquid nature of blood is the reason given.

Therefore, the pronoun ""it"" most likely refers to ""blood"" (candidate 1) rather than ""My heart"" (candidate 0).",1,1
33,My heart pumps blood because it is a muscle.,it,"0: My heart, 1: blood, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""it"" refers to ""My heart"" for the following reasons:

1. The sentence is explaining why the heart pumps blood.
2. The pronoun ""it"" is used to describe something that is a muscle.
3. The heart is a muscle, while blood is not.
4. The structure of the sentence suggests that ""it"" is referring back to the subject of the first clause, which is ""My heart.""

Therefore, the pronoun ""it"" clearly refers to ""My heart"" and not to ""blood"" or any other entity not mentioned in the candidates.",0,0
34,Joe smells better than Adam since he showers regularly.,he,"0: Joe, 1: Adam, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence compares Joe and Adam in terms of smell.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""he showers regularly.""
3. This clause provides an explanation for why one person smells better than the other.
4. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" refers to the person who smells better.
5. The sentence states that ""Joe smells better than Adam.""

Given this analysis, it's logical to conclude that ""he"" refers to Joe, as Joe is the one described as smelling better, and the regular showering explains why. Therefore, ""he"" most likely refers to Joe.",0,0
35,Joe smells better than Adam since he hardly ever showers.,he,"0: Joe, 1: Adam, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and logic of the sentence:

1. The sentence compares Joe and Adam in terms of smell.
2. It states that Joe smells better than Adam.
3. The reason given is that ""he hardly ever showers.""
4. Logically, the person who hardly ever showers would smell worse, not better.
5. Since Joe smells better, it's unlikely that ""he"" refers to Joe.
6. Therefore, ""he"" most likely refers to Adam, as Adam's lack of showering explains why Joe smells better than him.

Based on this reasoning, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Adam.",1,1
36,The pen is mightier than the sword because it can only stab things.,it,"0: The pen, 1: the sword, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine what ""it"" refers to. The sentence structure suggests that ""it"" is referring to the subject that ""can only stab things."" Given the context, it's more logical that a sword would be associated with stabbing rather than a pen. The sentence is using irony to subvert the common saying ""The pen is mightier than the sword"" by attributing a sword-like quality (stabbing) to the pen. Therefore, ""it"" most likely refers to ""the pen.""",1,0
37,The pen is mightier than the sword because it can be used to write world-changing documents.,it,"0: The pen, 1: the sword, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""it"" clearly refers to ""the pen"" for the following reasons:

1. The sentence is comparing the pen to the sword, stating that the pen is mightier.
2. The latter part of the sentence provides an explanation for why the pen is mightier, which is that ""it can be used to write world-changing documents.""
3. Logically, a pen is used for writing, while a sword cannot be used to write documents.

Therefore, ""it"" in this context must refer to ""the pen"" and not ""the sword"" or any other entity not mentioned in the text.",0,0
38,The cats attacked the humans because they were feral.,they,"0: The cats, 1: the humans, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence states: ""The cats attacked the humans because they were feral.""
2. The pronoun ""they"" is used to describe the reason for the attack.
3. Being ""feral"" is a characteristic typically associated with animals, not humans.
4. In this context, ""feral"" means wild or untamed, which is more likely to describe cats than humans.
5. The cats are the subject of the sentence and the ones performing the action (attacking).

Given these points, it's most logical that ""they"" refers to ""The cats."" The cats' feral nature is presented as the reason for their attack on the humans.",0,0
39,The cats attacked the humans because they smelled like fish.,they,"0: The cats, 1: the humans, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence has two main parts: ""The cats attacked the humans"" and ""because they smelled like fish.""
2. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the second part of the sentence, which explains the reason for the attack.
3. Logically, the reason for the attack would be related to the object of the attack (the humans) rather than the subject (the cats).
4. It's more likely that humans would smell like fish (perhaps from eating or handling fish) than cats smelling like fish.
5. The sentence implies that the smell of fish was the reason for the cats' attack.

Based on this analysis, it's most logical that ""they"" refers to ""the humans"" in this context.",1,1
40,Bob can beat Larry at arm wrestling because he has more muscles.,he,"0: Bob, 1: Larry, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence is comparing Bob and Larry in arm wrestling.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""because he has more muscles.""
3. Having more muscles would be an advantage in arm wrestling.
4. The sentence states that ""Bob can beat Larry,"" implying that Bob is the stronger one.

Given this information, it's logical to conclude that ""he"" refers to Bob, as Bob is the one who can beat Larry, and the reason given is having more muscles. The pronoun ""he"" is used to explain why Bob can win, so it must be referring to Bob.",0,0
41,Bob can beat Larry at arm wrestling because he is a toddler.,he,"0: Bob, 1: Larry, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence logically:

1. The pronoun ""he"" refers to someone who is a toddler.
2. The sentence states that Bob can beat Larry at arm wrestling.
3. It's highly unlikely that a toddler would be able to beat an adult (or even an older child) at arm wrestling.
4. Therefore, ""he"" must refer to Larry, as this would explain why Bob can beat him - because Larry is a toddler.

The pronoun ""he"" logically refers to Larry in this context.",1,1
42,Donald kicked King but he never cried.,he,"0: Donald, 1: King, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence states ""Donald kicked King but he never cried.""
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used after the conjunction ""but,"" which typically introduces a contrasting idea.
3. The act of kicking someone would usually cause the person being kicked to cry, not the person doing the kicking.
4. Therefore, it's more logical that ""he"" refers to King, who was kicked but didn't cry, rather than Donald, who did the kicking.

Based on this reasoning, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to King.",1,1
43,Donald kicked King but he never felt bad.,he,"0: Donald, 1: King, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence states ""Donald kicked King but he never felt bad.""
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used after the conjunction ""but,"" which typically introduces a contrasting idea.
3. The action of kicking is attributed to Donald, as he is the subject of the first part of the sentence.
4. The second part of the sentence, ""he never felt bad,"" implies a lack of remorse or guilt.
5. Logically, the person who would potentially feel bad about kicking someone would be the one who did the kicking, not the one who was kicked.

Given this analysis, it makes more sense for ""he"" to refer to Donald, as he is the one who performed the action (kicking) and would be the one who might or might not feel bad about it. King, being the recipient of the action, is less likely to be the subject of feeling or not feeling bad about the kicking.",0,0
44,Steve went to the meeting with John because he was asked to.,he,"0: Steve, 1: John, 2: Neither","To determine who ""he"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context:

1. The sentence states that ""Steve went to the meeting with John.""
2. The reason given is ""because he was asked to.""

The pronoun ""he"" is more likely to refer to Steve for the following reasons:
1. Steve is mentioned first in the sentence, making him the primary subject.
2. The sentence structure implies that Steve is the one who went to the meeting, with John being a secondary participant.
3. The phrase ""because he was asked to"" provides a reason for attending the meeting, which logically applies to the person who initiated the action (going to the meeting).

Therefore, it is most probable that Steve was the one who was asked to go to the meeting, and thus ""he"" refers to Steve.",0,0
45,Steve went to the meeting with John because he asked him to.,he,"0: Steve, 1: John, 2: Neither","To determine who ""he"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and the logical flow of the sentence.

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" is the subject who asked the other person to go to the meeting.
2. The pronoun ""he"" comes after both Steve and John are mentioned, so it could potentially refer to either of them.
3. However, the sentence implies that one person (the subject) asked the other person (the object) to go to the meeting.
4. Given the order of names in the sentence, it's more likely that John is the one who asked Steve to go to the meeting.
5. If Steve had asked John, the sentence would more likely be phrased as ""Steve asked John to go to the meeting with him.""

Therefore, based on the context and typical sentence structure, ""he"" most likely refers to John.",1,1
46,Mary gave Sandy her book because she needed it.,she,"0: Mary, 1: Sandy, 2: Neither","To determine who ""she"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context:

1. Mary gave Sandy her book.
2. The reason for giving the book is that ""she needed it.""

The pronoun ""she"" is more likely to refer to Sandy in this context because:

1. If Mary needed the book, she wouldn't have given it away.
2. The sentence implies that the book was given because of a need, and Sandy receiving the book suggests she's the one who needed it.

Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Sandy.",1,1
47,Mary gave Sandy her book because she is generous.,she,"0: Mary, 1: Sandy, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""because she is generous,"" which explains the reason for Mary giving Sandy her book. 

The act of giving a book is typically seen as a generous action. Since Mary is the one who gave the book to Sandy, it's more logical to assume that ""she"" refers to Mary, who is being described as generous for her act of giving.

Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Mary (candidate 0) in this context.",0,0
48,John visited Luke in the hospital because he was sick.,he,"0: John, 1: Luke, 2: Neither","To determine who the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. John visited Luke in the hospital
2. The reason for the visit was that ""he"" was sick

Given this information, it's more logical that Luke is the one who was sick, as people typically visit others in the hospital when those others are sick. If John was the one who was sick, it would be unusual for him to visit someone else in the hospital.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Luke.",1,1
49,John visited Luke in the hospital because he lived close by.,he,"0: John, 1: Luke, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. John visited Luke in the hospital
2. The reason for the visit is that ""he"" lived close by

The pronoun ""he"" is more likely to refer to John in this context because:

1. John is the subject of the main clause and the one performing the action of visiting.
2. The sentence implies that living close by is the reason for the visit. It makes more sense that the visitor (John) lives close to the hospital, rather than the patient (Luke) who is already in the hospital.
3. If Luke lived close by, it wouldn't necessarily be a reason for John to visit him in the hospital.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to John.",0,0
50,John hired Bill because he needed someone.,he,"0: John, 1: Bill, 2: Neither","To determine who ""he"" refers to in this sentence, we need to consider the context and logical flow:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" is the subject who needed someone.
2. John is the main subject of the sentence, performing the action of hiring.
3. The reason for hiring is given after ""because,"" indicating that the subject (John) had a need.
4. It's more logical that the person doing the hiring (John) is the one who needed someone, rather than the person being hired (Bill).

Therefore, ""he"" most likely refers to John, as John is the one who would need someone and consequently hire Bill.",0,0
51,John fired Bill because he was incompetent.,he,"0: John, 1: Bill, 2: Neither","To determine who the pronoun ""he"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and logical implications:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" is the reason for the firing.
2. John is the subject (the one doing the firing), while Bill is the object (the one being fired).
3. The pronoun ""he"" is associated with the attribute ""incompetent.""
4. It's more logical that someone would be fired for being incompetent, rather than firing someone else for being incompetent.
5. Therefore, ""he"" most likely refers to Bill, as Bill's incompetence is the probable reason for John firing him.

Based on this reasoning, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Bill.",1,1
52,John introduced Bill because he knew everyone.,he,"0: John, 1: Bill, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" is the subject of the subordinate clause ""because he knew everyone.""
2. The main clause ""John introduced Bill"" provides the context for this action.
3. The word ""because"" indicates that the following clause explains the reason for the introduction.
4. Logically, the person who ""knew everyone"" would be more likely to introduce someone else to the group.
5. Given this reasoning, it makes more sense that John, who initiated the introduction, is the one who knew everyone.

Therefore, ""he"" most likely refers to John, as he is the one who would have the motivation to introduce Bill based on knowing everyone.",0,0
53,John introduced Bill because he was new.,he,"0: John, 1: Bill, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence states that ""John introduced Bill because he was new.""
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause explaining the reason for the introduction.
3. Logically, the person who is ""new"" is more likely to be the one being introduced, not the one doing the introducing.
4. In this case, Bill is the one being introduced, which implies that Bill is the ""new"" person.
5. Therefore, ""he"" most likely refers to Bill.",1,1
54,John shot Bill and he was jailed.,he,"0: John, 1: Bill, 2: Neither","To determine who ""he"" refers to in this sentence, we need to consider the logical sequence of events and the most likely outcome:

1. John shot Bill - This is the main action of the sentence.
2. ""He was jailed"" - This is the consequence of the action.

In most cases, the person who commits a violent crime (shooting someone) would be the one who gets jailed. Therefore, it's more logical that ""he"" refers to John, who did the shooting, rather than Bill, who was the victim.

While it's theoretically possible that Bill could have been jailed for some unmentioned reason, this would be an unusual interpretation without additional context. The most straightforward and likely interpretation is that John was jailed as a consequence of shooting Bill.",0,0
55,John shot Bill and he died.,he,"0: John, 1: Bill, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""he"" refers to - John or Bill. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the context of someone dying. Given the sequence of events, it's more logical that ""he"" refers to Bill for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure suggests a cause-and-effect relationship: ""John shot Bill and he died.""
2. In this context, the person who is shot is more likely to die than the person doing the shooting.
3. If ""he"" referred to John, the sentence would imply that John shot Bill and then John died, which doesn't make logical sense in this context.

Therefore, it's most probable that ""he"" refers to Bill, who died as a result of being shot by John.",1,1
56,"The Mad Hatter tried to offer a cup of tea to the March Hare, but his hat was too distracting.",his,"0: The Mad Hatter, 1: the March Hare, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""his"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions two characters: The Mad Hatter and the March Hare.
2. The pronoun ""his"" is used in the phrase ""his hat was too distracting.""
3. The Mad Hatter is known for wearing a distinctive hat in the Alice in Wonderland story.
4. The sentence structure suggests that ""his"" refers to the subject of the sentence, which is ""The Mad Hatter.""
5. It would not make sense for ""his hat"" to refer to the March Hare, as hares are not typically associated with wearing hats.

Based on these points, it is most logical to conclude that ""his"" refers to The Mad Hatter.",0,0
57,"The Mad Hatter tried to offer a cup of tea to the March Hare, but his long ears were too distracting.",his,"0: The Mad Hatter, 1: the March Hare, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""his"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions two characters: The Mad Hatter and the March Hare.
2. The pronoun ""his"" is used in the phrase ""his long ears were too distracting.""
3. The Mad Hatter is the subject of the sentence, performing the action of trying to offer tea.
4. The March Hare is the object of the sentence, receiving the action.
5. Rabbits (hares) are known for having long ears, while hatters (humans) typically do not have notably long ears.

Given this analysis, it's most logical that ""his long ears"" refers to the March Hare. The long ears being distracting makes more sense in the context of a rabbit-like creature than a human character like the Mad Hatter.",1,1
58,Richard blackmailed Senator Carson so that his silence would be secured.,his,"0: Richard, 1: Senator Carson, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""his"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and logical flow of the sentence.

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""Richard"" is the subject performing the action of blackmailing.
2. ""Senator Carson"" is the object of the blackmail.
3. The pronoun ""his"" is used in the phrase ""his silence,"" which refers to the silence of the person being blackmailed.
4. Logically, the person whose silence needs to be secured is the one being blackmailed, not the blackmailer.

Therefore, ""his"" most likely refers to Senator Carson, as it is his silence that Richard is trying to secure through blackmail.",1,1
59,Richard blackmailed Senator Carson so that his rise to power would be secured.,his,"0: Richard, 1: Senator Carson, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""his"" most likely refers to Richard. The context suggests that Richard is the one taking action (blackmailing) to secure his own rise to power. It wouldn't make sense for Richard to blackmail Senator Carson to secure Senator Carson's rise to power. Therefore, ""his"" is referring to Richard's rise to power.",0,0
60,"Tradition dictated the captain hold the Stanley Cup first, and it was pretty.",it,"0: Tradition, 1: the Stanley Cup, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""it"" most likely refers to ""the Stanley Cup"" for the following reasons:

1. Proximity: ""it"" is closer to ""the Stanley Cup"" in the sentence structure.
2. Context: The Stanley Cup is a physical object that can be described as ""pretty,"" while ""Tradition"" is an abstract concept that is not typically described with this adjective.
3. Logical flow: The sentence is describing the tradition of the captain holding the Stanley Cup, and then commenting on its appearance. It makes more sense for ""it"" to refer to the Cup rather than the tradition itself.

Therefore, the pronoun ""it"" most likely refers to ""the Stanley Cup,"" which is candidate 1.",1,1
61,"Tradition dictated the captain hold the Stanley Cup first, and it is always followed.",it,"0: Tradition, 1: the Stanley Cup, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine what the pronoun ""it"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence mentions two main entities: ""Tradition"" and ""the Stanley Cup"".
2. The first part of the sentence states that ""Tradition dictated the captain hold the Stanley Cup first"".
3. The second part of the sentence says ""and it is always followed"".

Given this context, ""it"" most likely refers to ""Tradition"" for the following reasons:
1. ""Tradition"" is the subject of the first clause and the main topic of the sentence.
2. The phrase ""is always followed"" makes more sense when applied to a tradition rather than to the Stanley Cup itself.
3. It's more logical to say that a tradition is followed, rather than saying the Stanley Cup is followed.

Therefore, the pronoun ""it"" most likely refers to ""Tradition"".",0,0
62,The bat hit the ball because it was designed to hit.,it,"0: The bat, 1: the ball, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""it"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence and its context:

1. The sentence states: ""The bat hit the ball because it was designed to hit.""
2. The pronoun ""it"" is used in the clause ""because it was designed to hit.""
3. The verb phrase ""designed to hit"" is a key clue here.
4. Between a bat and a ball, a bat is the object that is typically designed for hitting.
5. Balls are designed to be hit, not to hit.
6. Therefore, the pronoun ""it"" most likely refers to the bat, as bats are designed to hit balls.

Based on this reasoning, the pronoun ""it"" refers to ""The bat"" in this sentence.",0,0
63,The bat hit the ball because it was designed to be hit.,it,"0: The bat, 1: the ball, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""it"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. ""The bat hit the ball"" is the main clause of the sentence.
2. ""because it was designed to be hit"" is a subordinate clause explaining the reason.

The pronoun ""it"" in this case refers to the object that was designed to be hit. In the context of baseball or similar sports, it's the ball that is designed to be hit, not the bat. The bat is designed to hit, but the ball is designed to be hit.

Therefore, ""it"" in this sentence refers to ""the ball.""",1,1
64,The program could successfully parse the file because it was programmed well.,it,"0: The program, 1: the file, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. The sentence is talking about two entities: ""the program"" and ""the file"".
2. The pronoun ""it"" is used later in the sentence.
3. The sentence states that ""it was programmed well"".
4. In this context, something that is ""programmed"" is typically a program, not a file.
5. Files are usually ""written"" or ""created"", but not ""programmed"".
6. Therefore, ""it"" most likely refers to ""the program"".

Based on this reasoning, we can conclude that the pronoun ""it"" refers to ""The program"".",0,0
65,The program could successfully parse the file because it was formatted well.,it,"0: The program, 1: the file, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""it"" refers to ""the file"" rather than ""The program"". The sentence is structured in a way that suggests the file's good formatting is the reason for the program's successful parsing. The pronoun ""it"" is used to avoid repeating ""the file"" in the latter part of the sentence. The program is the subject performing the action (parsing), while the file is the object being parsed and is the antecedent of ""it"".",1,1
66,The article about the fires said that they torched most of Seattle.,they,"0: The article, 1: the fires, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" refers to ""the fires"" for the following reasons:

1. Grammatical agreement: ""They"" is a plural pronoun, which matches with the plural noun ""fires.""

2. Logical sense: It's more logical that fires would torch a city, rather than an article torching a city.

3. Context: The sentence is discussing the content of an article about fires, and the action of torching is something that fires do, not articles.

Therefore, the pronoun ""they"" most likely refers to ""the fires"" (candidate 1) in this context.",1,1
67,The article about the fires said that they would research the situation further.,they,"0: The article, 1: the fires, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" is most likely referring to the people or organization responsible for researching the situation further, rather than ""The article"" or ""the fires."" 

""The article"" is an inanimate object that cannot conduct research, so it can be ruled out as the referent for ""they.""

""The fires"" are also inanimate and cannot perform research, so they can be eliminated as well.

The pronoun ""they"" is likely referring to an implied group of people, such as researchers, investigators, or officials who would be responsible for looking into the fire situation. This group is not explicitly mentioned in the given text, but it's a common practice to use ""they"" to refer to an unspecified group of people in authority or with responsibility.

Since neither of the given candidates (The article or the fires) is the correct referent for ""they,"" and the actual referent is not explicitly mentioned in the text, the appropriate answer is ""Neither.""",0,2
68,The winners were given the awards after they won.,they,"0: The winners, 1: the awards, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, let's analyze the sentence:

""The winners were given the awards after they won.""

1. ""The winners"" is the subject of the sentence and is plural.
2. ""The awards"" is the object of the sentence and is also plural.
3. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the clause ""after they won.""

The pronoun ""they"" logically refers to ""The winners"" because:
a) ""They"" is a plural pronoun, which matches ""The winners.""
b) The action of winning is associated with the winners, not the awards.
c) It makes sense that the winners received awards after winning, not that the awards won something.

Therefore, ""they"" most likely refers to ""The winners.""",0,0
69,The winners were given the awards after they were made.,they,"0: The winners, 1: the awards, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. ""The winners were given the awards"" - This is the main clause of the sentence.
2. ""after they were made"" - This is a subordinate clause that provides additional information.

The pronoun ""they"" in this context is more likely to refer to ""the awards"" for the following reasons:

1. It makes more logical sense for awards to be ""made"" rather than winners being ""made.""
2. The sentence implies a sequence of events: first, the awards were made, and then they were given to the winners.
3. ""The winners"" is the subject of the main clause, while ""the awards"" is the object. In the subordinate clause, ""they"" becomes the subject, which is a more natural transition for the object of the main clause.

Therefore, the pronoun ""they"" most likely refers to ""the awards.""",1,1
70,The man jumped on the neighbor's pool and he swam.,he,"0: The man, 1: the neighbor, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to ""The man"" for the following reasons:

1. ""The man"" is the subject of the first part of the sentence and is performing the action of jumping.
2. The sentence structure suggests a continuation of actions by the same person: first jumping, then swimming.
3. ""The neighbor"" is only mentioned as the owner of the pool, not as an active participant in the events described.
4. There's no indication that ""the neighbor"" is present or involved in the swimming action.

Therefore, it's most logical to conclude that ""he"" refers to ""The man"" who jumped on the pool and then swam.",0,0
71,The man jumped on the neighbor's pool and he stared.,he,"0: The man, 1: the neighbor, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence mentions two potential male subjects: ""The man"" and ""the neighbor"".
2. The action described is ""The man jumped on the neighbor's pool"".
3. The pronoun ""he"" is then used in conjunction with the action ""stared"".

Given this information, it's most logical that ""he"" refers to ""The man"" for the following reasons:
- ""The man"" is the subject of the first action (jumping), making him the focus of the sentence.
- It's more likely that the person who jumped on the pool would then stare, rather than the neighbor (who isn't explicitly mentioned as being present).
- ""The man"" is also the first and most prominent noun in the sentence, making it the most likely antecedent for the pronoun ""he"".

72,"The team shredded the report, so that it could rewrite a new one.",it,"0: The team, 1: the report, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun 'it' refers to 'The team' rather than 'the report'. The context suggests that after shredding the report, the subject (the team) intends to rewrite a new one. It wouldn't make sense for 'the report' to rewrite itself after being shredded. Therefore, 'it' logically refers to 'The team', which is the entity capable of rewriting a new report.",0,0
73,"The team shredded the report, so that it could be rewritten.",it,"0: The team, 1: the report, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""it"" refers to ""the report"" for the following reasons:

1. Logical sequence: The action of shredding is performed on the report, and the subsequent action (rewriting) is more likely to be associated with the report rather than the team.

2. Grammatical agreement: ""It"" is a singular pronoun, which agrees with ""the report"" (singular) rather than ""The team"" (which, although grammatically singular, implies a group of people).

3. Context: The act of rewriting is typically associated with documents or written materials, such as a report, rather than a group of people.

4. Proximity: ""The report"" is the noun closest to the pronoun ""it,"" which often indicates the referent in English.

Therefore, the pronoun ""it"" most likely refers to ""the report"" (candidate 1) in this context.",1,1

1. Bob is the subject of the sentence, initiating the action of asking.
2. Tom is the person being asked.
3. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the phrase ""if he could take him to the movies.""

Given this structure, it's more likely that ""he"" refers to Bob. The sentence implies that Bob is asking Tom for permission or ability to take Tom to the movies. If ""he"" referred to Tom, the sentence would be awkwardly phrased and less logical.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Bob (candidate 0).",0,0
75,Bob asked Tom if he could lend some money.,he,"0: Bob, 1: Tom, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" is ambiguous and could refer to either Bob or Tom. Let's analyze the context:

1. Bob is the subject of the sentence and the one doing the asking.
2. Tom is the person being asked.
3. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the context of someone who ""could lend some money.""

Given this information, it's more likely that ""he"" refers to Tom. The sentence implies that Bob is asking Tom if Tom could lend some money. It would be unusual for Bob to ask Tom if Bob himself could lend money, as Bob would already know if he could lend money or not.

Therefore, the most logical interpretation is that Bob is asking Tom if Tom (he) could lend some money.",1,1
76,Homer punched Flanders because he was being annoying.,he,"0: Homer, 1: Flanders, 2: Neither","To determine who the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" refers to the reason why Homer punched Flanders.
2. It's more logical that Flanders was being annoying, which prompted Homer to punch him, rather than Homer being annoying and punching Flanders as a result.
3. In English, pronouns typically refer to the most recently mentioned noun, which in this case is Flanders.

Given these points, it's most likely that ""he"" refers to Flanders, as Flanders being annoying would be the reason for Homer's action.",1,1
77,Homer punched Flanders because he was asked to.,he,"0: Homer, 1: Flanders, 2: Neither","To determine who ""he"" refers to in this sentence, we need to consider the context and the most logical interpretation:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" is the subject of ""was asked to,"" which is a passive construction.

78,Nelson punched Milhouse but he was not hurt.,he,"0: Nelson, 1: Milhouse, 2: Neither","To determine who ""he"" refers to in this sentence, we need to consider the context and logical implications:

1. The sentence states that ""Nelson punched Milhouse.""
2. It then says ""but he was not hurt.""
3. The use of ""but"" suggests a contrast or unexpected outcome.
4. Typically, when someone is punched, they are expected to be hurt.
5. Since the sentence emphasizes that ""he was not hurt,"" it's more likely referring to the person who was punched, which is Milhouse.
6. It would be less surprising if Nelson (the one doing the punching) was not hurt, so the emphasis makes less sense if ""he"" referred to Nelson.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Milhouse, as it's noteworthy that he was not hurt despite being punched.",1,1
79,Nelson punched Milhouse but he was not caught.,he,"0: Nelson, 1: Milhouse, 2: Neither","To determine who ""he"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and the most logical interpretation:

1. The sentence states that ""Nelson punched Milhouse.""

""The mermaid swam toward Sue and made her gasp.""

In this sentence, ""her"" is most likely referring to Sue for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure suggests that the mermaid's action (swimming toward Sue) caused a reaction (gasping) in someone else.
2. It's more logical that Sue would gasp upon seeing a mermaid swimming towards her, rather than the mermaid gasping at her own action.
3. The pronoun ""her"" is closer to ""Sue"" in the sentence, which often indicates the referent in English grammar.

81,The mermaid swam toward Sue and waved her tail.,her,"0: The mermaid, 1: Sue, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""her"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

2. The pronoun ""her"" is used in the phrase ""waved her tail.""
3. Logically, a tail is a body part that belongs to the mermaid, not to Sue (assuming Sue is a human).
4. Mermaids are known for having tails, while humans do not.
5. The action of waving a tail is something a mermaid would do, not a human.

Based on this analysis, it's clear that ""her"" refers to the mermaid's tail, not Sue's. Therefore, the pronoun ""her"" refers to the mermaid.",0,0
82,The mother bear attacked Karen because she had gotten too close to her cub.,she,"0: The mother bear, 1: Karen, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence mentions two female entities: the mother bear and Karen.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""because she had gotten too close to her cub.""
3. It's more logical that Karen, a human, would get too close to a bear cub, rather than the mother bear getting too close to her own cub.
4. The mother bear's action (attacking) is a response to someone getting too close to her cub.

Given this reasoning, it makes more sense that ""she"" refers to Karen, as Karen is the one who likely got too close to the bear cub, prompting the mother bear to attack.",1,1
83,The mother bear attacked Karen because she was worried for her cub.,she,"0: The mother bear, 1: Karen, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to the mother bear. The context suggests that the reason for the attack was worry for her cub, which is a behavior typically associated with a protective mother bear. It wouldn't make sense for Karen to be worried about the bear's cub, so ""she"" must refer to the mother bear.",0,0
84,"Mary smiled at Susan, but she did not smile back.",she,"0: Mary, 1: Susan, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, let's analyze the sentence:

""Mary smiled at Susan, but she did not smile back.""

In this context, ""she"" is more likely to refer to Susan because:

1. The sentence structure suggests a contrast between two actions: Mary smiling and someone not smiling back.
2. It would be redundant and less logical for Mary to smile and then not smile back at herself.
3. The natural flow of the sentence implies that Susan is the one who did not reciprocate the smile.

Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Susan in this sentence.",1,1
85,"Mary smiled at Susan, but she was not happy to see her.",she,"0: Mary, 1: Susan, 2: Neither","To determine who ""she"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and the logical flow of the sentence.

1. The sentence starts with ""Mary smiled at Susan,"" which sets up the initial interaction between the two people.

2. The conjunction ""but"" introduces a contrast to the initial action.

3. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the contrasting clause, indicating that one of the two people mentioned is not happy to see the other.

4. Given that Mary is the one who smiled initially, it's more likely that Susan is the one who ""was not happy to see her.""

5. If Mary had been the one who was not happy, it would be inconsistent with her action of smiling.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Susan (candidate 1).",0,1
86,The leech latched onto the hippo so that it could enjoy the sunshine.,it,"0: The leech, 1: the hippo, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun 'it' refers to 'The leech' for the following reasons:
1. The sentence structure suggests that 'it' is the subject of the second clause, which is performing the action of enjoying the sunshine.
2. Leeches are known to attach themselves to larger animals, often for feeding purposes.
3. It's more logical that the leech would be the one enjoying the sunshine while latched onto the hippo, rather than the hippo enjoying the sunshine because of the leech.
4. Grammatically, 'it' is singular, which matches with 'The leech' (singular) rather than 'the hippo' (also singular, but less likely given the context).",1,0
87,The leech latched onto the hippo because it was hungry.,it,"0: The leech, 1: the hippo, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""it"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence and its context:

1. The sentence describes a leech latching onto a hippo.
2. The pronoun ""it"" is used in the clause ""because it was hungry.""
3. Leeches are known to be parasitic creatures that feed on the blood of other animals.
4. Hippos are not typically described as ""hungry"" in this context.

Given this information, it's more logical and natural to assume that the leech was hungry, which is why it latched onto the hippo. Leeches seek out hosts to feed on, while hippos don't typically latch onto other animals when they're hungry.

Therefore, the pronoun ""it"" most likely refers to the leech.",0,0
88,The people protested the government because they were hungry.,they,"0: The people, 1: the government, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and logic of the sentence:

1. The sentence states that ""The people protested the government because they were hungry.""
2. It's more logical that the people would be hungry, rather than the government.
3. The hunger is presented as the reason for the protest, which aligns with the people's motivation to protest.
4. Governments, as institutions, are not typically described as being ""hungry"" in a literal sense.

Therefore, it makes the most sense that ""they"" refers to ""The people"" in this context.",0,0
89,The people protested the government because they were raising taxes.,they,"0: The people, 1: the government, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and logic of the sentence:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""they"" is the subject of the clause ""were raising taxes.""
2. Logically, it's the government that typically has the power to raise taxes, not the people.
3. The people are protesting against the action of raising taxes, which implies they are not the ones doing it.
4. The government is the entity being protested against, which aligns with them being the ones raising taxes.

Therefore, ""they"" most likely refers to ""the government"" in this context.",1,1
90,I drank the beer with a lime because it was cold.,it,"0: the beer, 1: a lime, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""it"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence and consider which option makes the most logical sense.

1. ""the beer"": It's common for beer to be served cold, and people often prefer to drink cold beer.
2. ""a lime"": While a lime could be cold, it's less likely that the coldness of the lime would be the primary reason for drinking the beer with it.
3. Neither: This option doesn't apply here, as ""it"" clearly refers to one of the mentioned items.

Given the context, it's more logical that ""it"" refers to ""the beer"" being cold rather than the lime. People typically drink beer cold, and the coldness of the beer would be a more relevant factor in the drinking experience than the temperature of the lime.

Therefore, the pronoun ""it"" most likely refers to ""the beer"" (candidate 0).",0,0
91,I drank the beer with a lime because it was sour.,it,"0: the beer, 1: a lime, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""it"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence describes drinking beer with a lime.
2. The pronoun ""it"" is used in the clause ""because it was sour.""
3. The word ""sour"" is typically used to describe taste.
4. Between beer and lime, lime is more commonly associated with a sour taste.
5. The sentence structure suggests that the lime was added to the beer because of a certain quality (sourness).

Based on this analysis, it's more likely that ""it"" refers to ""a lime"" rather than ""the beer."" The lime's sourness is probably the reason it was added to the beer.",1,1
92,The employer talked to the employee about being loyal to him.,him,"0: The employer, 1: the employee, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""him"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and structure of the sentence:

1. The sentence is about the employer talking to the employee.
2. The topic of the conversation is ""being loyal to him.""
3. In this context, it's more likely that the employee would be expected to be loyal to the employer, rather than the other way around.
4. The pronoun ""him"" is used in a way that suggests it refers to the person to whom loyalty is owed.

Given these points, it's most logical that ""him"" refers to the employer. The employer is talking to the employee about being loyal to the employer (him). It wouldn't make sense for the employer to be discussing the employee's loyalty to the employee himself.",0,0
93,The employer talked to the employee about firing him.,him,"0: The employer, 1: the employee, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""him"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and logical flow of the sentence:

1. The sentence involves two people: the employer and the employee.
2. The action described is ""talked to"" and ""firing.""
3. The pronoun ""him"" is used in the context of firing.

It's highly unlikely that the employer would be talking to the employee about firing the employer (himself). In a professional setting, it's much more common for an employer to discuss firing an employee.

Therefore, the pronoun ""him"" most likely refers to the employee, as the employer is talking about firing the employee.",1,1
94,A chicken pecked at a bug and it ran away.,it,"0: A chicken, 1: a bug, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""it"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence and consider the most logical subject for the action ""ran away.""

1. ""A chicken pecked at a bug"" - This establishes the two main subjects in the sentence.
2. ""and it ran away"" - We need to determine which of these subjects is most likely to run away in this context.

Considering the typical behavior of chickens and bugs:
- Chickens are predators in this scenario and are unlikely to run away after pecking at their prey.
- Bugs are prey and are more likely to flee when attacked or threatened.

Therefore, it is more logical and natural for the bug to be the one that ran away after being pecked at by the chicken. The pronoun ""it"" most likely refers to the bug.",1,1
95,The dogs hate the fleas because they suck blood.,they,"0: The dogs, 1: the fleas, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. ""The dogs hate the fleas"" - This establishes the main subjects of the sentence.
2. ""because they suck blood"" - This is the reason for the dogs' hatred.

The pronoun ""they"" is used in the context of sucking blood. We need to consider which of the candidates is known for sucking blood:

- Dogs do not typically suck blood.
- Fleas are well-known for sucking blood as their primary food source.

Therefore, it's logical to conclude that ""they"" refers to ""the fleas"" in this sentence. The fleas are the ones sucking blood, which is the reason why the dogs hate them.",1,1
96,The dogs hate the fleas because they hate bugs.,they,"0: The dogs, 1: the fleas, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. ""The dogs hate the fleas"" is the main clause.
2. ""because they hate bugs"" is the subordinate clause explaining the reason.

The pronoun ""they"" is used in the subordinate clause to refer to the subject of the main clause. In this case, ""they"" refers to ""The dogs"" for the following reasons:

1. Dogs are more likely to have feelings or emotions like ""hate"" compared to fleas.
2. The sentence implies that the subject (dogs) hates fleas because of a characteristic or action of the subject itself.
3. It's more logical for dogs to hate bugs (including fleas) than for fleas to hate bugs (as fleas are insects themselves).

Therefore, ""they"" most likely refers to ""The dogs"" in this context.",0,0
97,Steven Seagal challenged Jean Claude Van Damme to a fight because he wanted to prove he was the stronger man.,he,"0: Steven Seagal, 1: Jean Claude Van Damme, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Steven Seagal. The sentence structure indicates that Steven Seagal is the subject who performed the action of challenging Jean Claude Van Damme. The reason given for the challenge (""because he wanted to prove he was the stronger man"") logically applies to the person initiating the challenge, which is Steven Seagal. Therefore, ""he"" in this context refers to Steven Seagal.",0,0
98,Steven Seagal challenged Jean Claude Van Damme to a fight because he is a worthy opponent.,he,"0: Steven Seagal, 1: Jean Claude Van Damme, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. Steven Seagal is the subject of the sentence, performing the action of challenging.
2. Jean Claude Van Damme is the object of the challenge.
3. The pronoun ""he"" appears in the clause ""because he is a worthy opponent.""

Logically, the person being referred to as a ""worthy opponent"" would be the one being challenged, not the one doing the challenging. Therefore, ""he"" most likely refers to Jean Claude Van Damme.

It wouldn't make sense for Steven Seagal to challenge someone because he (Seagal) is a worthy opponent. The more logical interpretation is that Seagal is challenging Van Damme because Van Damme is considered a worthy opponent.",1,1
99,Girls like puppies because they are adorable.,they,"0: Girls, 1: puppies, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence is: ""Girls like puppies because they are adorable.""
2. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the clause ""they are adorable.""
3. Logically, the word ""adorable"" is more likely to describe puppies rather than girls in this context.
4. The structure ""because they are"" suggests that ""they"" refers to the reason why girls like puppies.
5. It makes more sense that girls like puppies because puppies are adorable, rather than girls liking puppies because girls themselves are adorable.

Based on this analysis, it is most logical that ""they"" refers to ""puppies"" in this sentence.",1,1
100,Girls like puppies because they like adorable things.,they,"0: Girls, 1: puppies, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence is: ""Girls like puppies because they like adorable things.""
2. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the second part of the sentence, after ""because.""
3. Logically, the pronoun ""they"" is referring to the subject of the main clause, which is ""Girls.""
4. It wouldn't make sense for ""they"" to refer to ""puppies"" in this context, as the sentence is explaining why girls like puppies, not why puppies like adorable things.
5. The sentence is implying that girls like puppies because girls (they) like adorable things.

Therefore, the pronoun ""they"" most likely refers to ""Girls"" in this sentence.",0,0
101,Jack got more votes than John because the people liked him.,him,"0: Jack, 1: John, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""him"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""him"" refers to the person who was liked by the people.
2. The sentence states that Jack got more votes than John.
3. The reason given for Jack getting more votes is that ""the people liked him.""

Based on this analysis, it's logical to conclude that ""him"" refers to Jack. The sentence is explaining why Jack received more votes, and the pronoun ""him"" is used to refer back to Jack as the subject of people's preference.",0,0
102,Jack got more votes than John because the people did not like him.,him,"0: Jack, 1: John, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""him"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence states that ""Jack got more votes than John.""
2. The reason given is ""because the people did not like him.""

In this context, ""him"" is more likely to refer to John rather than Jack. The sentence implies that Jack won because people didn't like the other candidate, which would be John. If ""him"" referred to Jack, it wouldn't make sense for Jack to get more votes if people didn't like him.

Therefore, the pronoun ""him"" most likely refers to John.",1,1
103,The car passed the truck because it was going too slow.,it,"0: The car, 1: the truck, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""it"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence describes a situation where one vehicle (the car) passed another vehicle (the truck).
2. The reason given for this action is that ""it was going too slow.""
3. Logically, the vehicle that was going too slow would be the one that was passed.
4. In this case, the car passed the truck, which implies that the truck was the slower vehicle.

Therefore, ""it"" in this sentence most likely refers to ""the truck"" because the truck's slow speed was the reason for the car passing it.",1,1
104,The car passed the truck because it needed to go faster.,it,"0: The car, 1: the truck, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""it"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and logic of the sentence.

The sentence states that ""The car passed the truck because it needed to go faster."" Let's consider each candidate:

0: The car - This is the most logical referent for ""it"" in this context. Cars are typically associated with the need for speed, especially when passing other vehicles. The action of passing implies that the car needed to go faster than the truck.

1: The truck - It's less likely that ""it"" refers to the truck. If the truck needed to go faster, it wouldn't make sense for the car to pass it. The truck's speed is not the reason for the car's action.

2: Neither - This option is not applicable here, as ""it"" clearly refers to one of the vehicles mentioned in the sentence.

Given this analysis, the most logical conclusion is that ""it"" refers to the car. The car needed to go faster, which is why it passed the truck.",0,0
105,My phone is working better than your phone because it is a newer model.,it,"0: My phone, 1: your phone, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""it"" refers to, let's analyze the sentence:

""My phone is working better than your phone because it is a newer model.""

The pronoun ""it"" is used to refer back to one of the phones mentioned earlier in the sentence. The key information is that ""it is a newer model,"" which explains why one phone is working better than the other.

Given that the sentence states ""My phone is working better,"" it's logical to conclude that ""my phone"" is the one that is newer and thus working better. Therefore, ""it"" most likely refers to ""my phone.""",0,0
106,My phone is working better than your phone because it is broken.,it,"0: My phone, 1: your phone, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""it"" refers to ""your phone"" because:

1. The sentence compares two phones: ""My phone"" and ""your phone"".
2. The statement ""it is broken"" is used to explain why ""My phone is working better"".
3. Logically, if one phone is working better, it's because the other phone is not working well or is broken.
4. Therefore, ""it"" must refer to ""your phone"" as the broken one, which explains why ""My phone is working better"".

The pronoun ""it"" cannot refer to ""My phone"" because it wouldn't make sense for a phone that is working better to be broken. It also can't refer to neither, as there are no other objects mentioned in the sentence that ""it"" could logically refer to.",1,1
107,Raja wanted Rena to take the job because he would be a good candidate.,he,"0: Raja, 1: Rena, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. The pronoun ""he"" is masculine, so it refers to a male person.
2. We have two names mentioned: Raja and Rena.
3. Raja is typically a male name, while Rena is typically a female name.
4. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" refers to the person who ""would be a good candidate"" for the job.
5. The sentence states that Raja wanted Rena to take the job, implying that Rena is the one being considered for the position.
6. Therefore, ""he"" most likely refers to Raja, as he is the one thinking Rena would be a good candidate.

Based on this reasoning, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Raja.",1,0
108,Raja wanted Rena to take the job because he wanted to leave.,he,"0: Raja, 1: Rena, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Raja. We can determine this because:

1. Raja is the subject of the main clause and is mentioned first, making him the more prominent character in the sentence.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is masculine, which matches Raja (typically a male name) but not Rena (typically a female name).
3. The context suggests that Raja is the one who wants to leave, as it explains his motivation for wanting Rena to take the job.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Raja, which is candidate 0.",0,0
109,"Sheila tried to repair the old jalopy, even though she had not run in three decades.",she,"0: Sheila, 1: the old jalopy, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence:

1. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the sentence.
2. ""She"" typically refers to a female person, not an object.
3. There are two potential candidates: Sheila (a person) and the old jalopy (an object).
4. The sentence states that ""she had not run in three decades.""
5. While it's possible for a car (jalopy) to not run for decades, the use of ""she"" strongly suggests a person rather than an object.
6. Sheila is the only person mentioned in the sentence.

Therefore, it's most logical that ""she"" refers to Sheila, not the old jalopy.",1,0
110,"Sheila tried to repair the old jalopy, even though she had not worked on cars in three decades.",she,"0: Sheila, 1: the old jalopy, 2: Neither","The pronoun ""she"" in this sentence clearly refers to Sheila for the following reasons:

1. Gender agreement: ""She"" is a feminine pronoun, which matches with the feminine name ""Sheila.""
2. Logical subject: Sheila is the main subject of the sentence, performing the action of trying to repair the car.
3. Contextual continuity: The sentence continues to describe Sheila's past experience with working on cars, which logically follows from her being the one attempting the repair.
4. Grammatical structure: ""She"" is used as the subject of the dependent clause, which provides additional information about the main subject, Sheila.

The old jalopy is an inanimate object and cannot be referred to as ""she"" in standard English usage. Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" must refer to Sheila.",0,0
111,The ghost entered the house because it was haunting.,it,"0: The ghost, 1: the house, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""it"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. ""The ghost entered the house"" - This is the main clause of the sentence.
2. ""because it was haunting"" - This is a subordinate clause explaining why the ghost entered the house.

The pronoun ""it"" is used in the subordinate clause as the subject of ""was haunting."" Logically, the entity that is doing the haunting would be the ghost, not the house. Houses are typically the objects being haunted, not the entities doing the haunting.

Therefore, ""it"" most likely refers to ""The ghost"" in this context.",0,0
112,The ghost entered the house because it was haunted.,it,"0: The ghost, 1: the house, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence:

""The ghost entered the house because it was haunted.""

The pronoun ""it"" in this sentence refers to ""the house"" for the following reasons:

1. Logical context: It makes more sense for a house to be haunted rather than a ghost. Ghosts are typically the entities that haunt places, not the ones being haunted.

2. Sentence structure: The pronoun ""it"" is used in the dependent clause that explains why the ghost entered the house. This suggests that ""it"" is referring to the house, which is the object of the main clause.

3. Proximity: While not always a definitive factor, ""the house"" is the noun closest to the pronoun ""it,"" which can sometimes be an indicator of what the pronoun is referring to.

Therefore, the most logical interpretation is that ""it"" refers to ""the house"" (candidate 1).",1,1
113,The boy escaped the cop but he continued to flee.,he,"0: The boy, 1: the cop, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to ""The boy"" for the following reasons:

1. The subject of the first clause is ""The boy,"" making him the primary focus of the sentence.
2. The action of ""escaping"" is attributed to the boy, and the continuation of fleeing logically follows this action.
3. It would be unusual for the cop to ""continue to flee"" after the boy has escaped, as the cop's role is typically to pursue, not flee.
4. The use of ""but"" suggests a contrast or continuation of the boy's actions, rather than a shift in focus to the cop.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to ""The boy"" in this context.",0,0
114,The boy escaped the cop but he continued to search.,he,"0: The boy, 1: the cop, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and logic of the sentence:

1. The sentence describes two actions: escaping and searching.
2. ""The boy escaped the cop"" indicates that the boy was running away from the cop.
3. The pronoun ""he"" is followed by ""continued to search,"" which implies an ongoing action.
4. It's logical that the cop would be the one searching, as they are trying to catch the boy who escaped.
5. It wouldn't make sense for the boy to be searching after escaping.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to ""the cop"" who continued to search for the boy who escaped.",1,1
115,The needle punctured the skin but it failed to register pain.,it,"0: The needle, 1: the skin, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""it"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. ""The needle punctured the skin"" is the main clause.
2. ""but it failed to register pain"" is the second clause connected by the conjunction ""but"".

The pronoun ""it"" is the subject of the second clause. Logically, ""it"" refers to the entity that would be expected to register pain. In this context, it's more likely that the skin would register pain rather than the needle. The needle is an inanimate object that doesn't have the capacity to feel or register pain.

Therefore, ""it"" most likely refers to ""the skin"" (candidate 1).",1,1
116,The needle punctured the skin but it failed to administer pain.,it,"0: The needle, 1: the skin, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""it"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. ""The needle punctured the skin"" - This is the main action of the sentence.
2. ""but it failed to administer pain"" - This is a contrasting clause that provides additional information.

The pronoun ""it"" is the subject of the second clause and is performing the action of ""failing to administer pain."" Logically, the entity that would be expected to administer pain in this context is the needle, not the skin. The skin is the recipient of the action (being punctured) and wouldn't typically be described as administering or failing to administer pain.

Therefore, ""it"" most likely refers to ""The needle"" in this sentence.",0,0
117,The lion saw the fish and it pounced.,it,"0: The lion, 1: the fish, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. The sentence describes two animals: a lion and a fish.
2. The pronoun ""it"" is used in the second part of the sentence.
3. The action associated with ""it"" is ""pounced.""
4. Pouncing is a behavior typically associated with predators, especially big cats like lions.
5. Fish do not pounce; they swim.
6. The lion, being a predator, is more likely to pounce on its prey (in this case, the fish).

Given these points, it's clear that ""it"" refers to the lion. The lion saw the fish, and then the lion pounced, likely attempting to catch the fish.",0,0
118,The lion saw the fish and it was swimming.,it,"0: The lion, 1: the fish, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. ""The lion saw the fish"" - This establishes two entities: the lion and the fish.
2. ""and it was swimming"" - The pronoun ""it"" is used here, referring to one of these entities.

Now, we need to determine which entity ""it"" refers to. The key information is the action ""swimming"". 

Lions are land animals and are not known for swimming, while fish are aquatic animals that swim as their primary mode of movement. Therefore, it's much more logical and likely that ""it"" refers to the fish.

The pronoun ""it"" cannot refer to ""The lion"" because lions don't typically swim, and it wouldn't make sense in this context. It clearly refers to ""the fish"" as fish are known for swimming.",1,1
119,The clown smiled at the child and he cried.,he,"0: The clown, 1: the child, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and logic of the sentence:

1. The sentence describes two actions: smiling and crying.
2. The clown is the subject of the first action (smiling).
3. The pronoun ""he"" is the subject of the second action (crying).
4. It's more logical and common for a child to cry in response to seeing a clown, rather than a clown crying after smiling at a child.
5. The sentence structure suggests a cause-and-effect relationship between the clown's smile and the subsequent crying.

Based on these observations, it's most likely that ""he"" refers to the child. The clown smiled, which caused the child to cry, possibly out of fear or surprise.",1,1
120,The clown smiled at the child and he offered him a balloon.,he,"0: The clown, 1: the child, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

2. The pronoun ""he"" is used as the subject of the second part of the sentence.
3. The action associated with ""he"" is ""offered him a balloon"".
4. Logically, it makes more sense for the clown to offer a balloon to the child, rather than the child offering a balloon to the clown.
5. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" refers to the first subject mentioned (the clown), who then performs an action towards the second subject (the child).

The pronoun ""they"" in this sentence is most likely referring to ""the chimps"" for the following reasons:

1. Logical context: It makes more sense that the chimps were hungry, which is why they were given bananas. Scientists typically don't give food to bananas.

2. Sentence structure: The chimps are the recipients of the action (receiving bananas), and the reason for this action is explained by the clause ""because they were hungry."" This creates a logical connection between the chimps and the state of being hungry.

3. Animate vs. inanimate: Chimps are living beings that can experience hunger, while bananas are inanimate objects that cannot be hungry.

Therefore, the pronoun ""they"" most likely refers to ""the chimps"" (candidate 0).",0,0
122,The scientists gave the chimps some bananas because they were ripe.,they,"0: the chimps, 1: some bananas, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. ""The scientists gave the chimps some bananas because they were ripe.""

In this sentence, ""they"" is most likely referring to ""some bananas"" for the following reasons:

1. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the clause ""because they were ripe.""
2. Ripeness is a characteristic typically associated with fruits, including bananas.
3. It wouldn't make sense to say ""because the chimps were ripe"" or ""because the scientists were ripe.""
4. The sentence is explaining the reason why the scientists gave the bananas to the chimps, which is because the bananas were ripe.

Therefore, the most logical interpretation is that ""they"" refers to ""some bananas.""",1,1
123,The boss fired the worker when he stopped performing well.,he,"0: The boss, 1: the worker, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and logical flow of the sentence:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" refers to the subject of the subordinate clause ""when he stopped performing well.""
2. It's more likely that a worker would be fired for poor performance rather than a boss.
3. The phrase ""stopped performing well"" implies a decline in job performance, which is typically associated with an employee (worker) rather than a boss.
4. It wouldn't make sense for the boss to fire the worker because the boss himself stopped performing well.

Given these points, it's most logical to conclude that ""he"" refers to ""the worker"" in this context.",1,1
124,The boss fired the worker when he called him into the office.,he,"0: The boss, 1: the worker, 2: Neither","To determine who ""he"" refers to in this sentence, we need to consider the context and the most logical interpretation:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" is the subject of the clause ""when he called him into the office.""
2. It's more likely that the boss would call the worker into the office, rather than the other way around.
3. The action of firing typically follows a meeting or discussion, which aligns with calling someone into the office.
4. The pronoun ""him"" later in the sentence likely refers to the worker, as it would be unusual for the worker to call the boss into the office to fire them.

Given these points, it's most logical that ""he"" refers to the boss, who called the worker into the office to fire them.",0,0
125,The outlet powered the lamp when it had electricity.,it,"0: The outlet, 1: the lamp, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""it"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence states: ""The outlet powered the lamp when it had electricity.""
2. The pronoun ""it"" is used in the clause ""when it had electricity.""
3. Logically, the entity that ""has electricity"" would be the outlet, not the lamp.
4. The lamp is powered by the outlet, but it doesn't ""have"" electricity itself.
5. The outlet is the source of electricity, so it makes sense that it would be the one to ""have"" electricity.

Therefore, the pronoun ""it"" most likely refers to ""The outlet"" in this context.",0,0
126,The outlet powered the lamp when it was plugged in.,it,"0: The outlet, 1: the lamp, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""it"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. ""The outlet powered the lamp"" - This is the main clause, establishing the relationship between the outlet and the lamp.
2. ""when it was plugged in"" - This is a subordinate clause providing additional information.

The pronoun ""it"" in this context most likely refers to ""the lamp"" for the following reasons:
1. Lamps are typically the objects that get plugged in, not outlets.
2. The sentence structure suggests that the lamp being plugged in is what allows the outlet to power it.
3. It would be redundant and less logical to say that an outlet powers a lamp when the outlet itself is plugged in.

Therefore, the most sensible interpretation is that ""it"" refers to ""the lamp.""",1,1
127,The paintball player was mad at the referee because he missed a call.,he,"0: The paintball player, 1: the referee, 2: Neither","To determine who ""he"" refers to in this sentence, we need to consider the context and the most logical interpretation:

1. The sentence states that ""The paintball player was mad at the referee.""
2. The reason for being mad is given: ""because he missed a call.""
3. In the context of sports, referees are responsible for making calls during the game.
4. It's more likely that a player would be angry at a referee for missing a call, rather than a referee being angry at themselves for missing a call.
5. The pronoun ""he"" is more likely to refer to the referee in this case, as it explains why the paintball player was mad at him.

Therefore, the most logical interpretation is that ""he"" refers to the referee who missed a call, which caused the paintball player to be mad at him.",1,1
128,The paintball player was mad at the referee because he was called out but shouldn't.,he,"0: The paintball player, 1: the referee, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and logic of the sentence:

1. The sentence describes a situation where the paintball player is mad at the referee.
2. The reason for the player's anger is that ""he was called out but shouldn't.""
3. In paintball, it's the referee who calls players out, not the other way around.
4. The phrase ""but shouldn't"" implies that the person being called out disagrees with the decision.

Given these points, it's logical to conclude that ""he"" refers to the paintball player. The player is the one who was called out (by the referee) and believes that this call was incorrect, which is why he is mad at the referee.",0,0
129,The network heads cancelled the TV shows because they were not doing well.,they,"0: The network heads, 1: the TV shows, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" most likely refers to ""the TV shows"" for the following reasons:

1. Context: The sentence is about cancelling TV shows, which implies that something was not performing well.

2. Logical flow: It makes more sense that TV shows would be cancelled because they (the shows) were not doing well, rather than the network heads not doing well.

3. Proximity: ""The TV shows"" is the closest noun phrase to the pronoun ""they"" in the sentence, which often indicates the referent.

4. Subject-verb agreement: ""They"" is plural, which matches with ""the TV shows"" (plural) rather than ""The network heads"" (also plural, but less likely given the context).

130,The network heads cancelled the TV shows because they did not like the content.,they,"0: The network heads, 1: the TV shows, 2: Neither","In this sentence, 'they' refers to 'The network heads' because:
  1. 'They' is the subject of the verb 'did not like', which implies an action or opinion.
  2. The network heads are in a position to make decisions about TV shows, including cancelling them based on their preferences.
  3. It wouldn't make sense for 'they' to refer to 'the TV shows' because TV shows don't have the ability to like or dislike content.
  4. The structure of the sentence suggests that 'The network heads' performed the action (cancelling) because of their opinion (not liking the content).",0,0
131,The cheetah outran the antelope so it got to eat.,it,"0: The cheetah, 1: the antelope, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""it"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and logic of the sentence:

1. The sentence describes a chase between a cheetah and an antelope.
2. The cheetah is said to have outrun the antelope.
3. The pronoun ""it"" is used in the context of ""got to eat.""

Given this information, we can deduce that:
- The cheetah, being the predator, is the one that would eat after a successful chase.
- The antelope, being the prey, would not be eating if it was outrun by the cheetah.

Therefore, the pronoun ""it"" logically refers to the cheetah, as it is the subject that outran the antelope and consequently got to eat.",0,0
132,The cheetah outran the antelope so it got eaten.,it,"0: The cheetah, 1: the antelope, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. ""The cheetah outran the antelope"" - This establishes that the cheetah was faster than the antelope.
2. ""so it got eaten"" - This is the key part for determining what ""it"" refers to.

In nature, cheetahs are predators and antelopes are prey. When a cheetah outruns an antelope, it's typically to catch and eat the antelope, not the other way around. 

Therefore, ""it"" in this sentence must refer to the antelope. The sentence is saying that because the cheetah was faster (outran the antelope), the antelope was caught and eaten.

It wouldn't make sense for the cheetah to be eaten after outrunning the antelope, so we can confidently say that ""it"" refers to the antelope.",1,1
133,The keys typed the words because they were meant to be typed.,they,"0: The keys, 1: the words, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" most likely refers to ""the words"" for the following reasons:

1. Grammatical agreement: ""They"" is a plural pronoun, which agrees with the plural noun ""words"" but not with the singular noun ""keys.""

2. Logical sense: The sentence implies that something ""was meant to be typed."" It makes more sense for words to be meant to be typed rather than keys.

3. Sentence structure: The pronoun ""they"" appears after both ""the keys"" and ""the words"" in the sentence, but it's closer to and more directly related to ""the words"" in terms of the sentence's meaning.

4. Active vs. passive roles: The keys are described as performing an action (typing), while the words are described as being acted upon (being typed). The pronoun ""they"" is used in a passive context (""were meant to be typed""), which aligns better with ""the words.""

Therefore, the most logical referent for ""they"" in this sentence is ""the words.""",1,"1

134,The keys typed the words because they were meant to be typed on.,they,"0: The keys, 1: the words, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" most likely refers to ""the words"" rather than ""the keys."" This is because:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""they"" is the subject of the clause ""were meant to be typed on.""
2. It makes more logical sense for words to be meant to be typed on, rather than keys themselves.
3. The keys are the instruments used for typing, while the words are the result of the typing action.

1. The sentence mentions two groups: ""The racquetball players"" and ""the other students.""
2. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the clause ""they were using the racquetball courts to play badminton.""
3. The sentence states that the racquetball players were annoyed by the other students.
4. The reason for the annoyance is that someone was using the racquetball courts for badminton.

Given this information, it's clear that ""they"" refers to ""the other students"" because:
a) The racquetball players wouldn't be annoyed by their own actions.
b) The other students are the ones misusing the racquetball courts for badminton, which is the cause of the annoyance.

137,The teachers scolded the students because they would not learn the material.,they,"0: The teachers, 1: the students, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and logic of the sentence:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""they"" refers to the subject of the second clause, which explains why the teachers scolded the students.

2. It's more logical that the students would be the ones not learning the material, rather than the teachers.

3. Teachers are typically responsible for teaching, while students are expected to learn. The act of not learning is more commonly associated with students.

4. The sentence implies that the scolding was a result of someone not learning, which aligns with the students' role rather than the teachers'.

Based on these points, it's clear that ""they"" refers to ""the students"" in this context.",1,1
138,The teachers scolded the students because they were the authority figures.,they,"0: The teachers, 1: the students, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

139,The plane was in the sky and it was fast.,it,"0: The plane, 1: the sky, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""it"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. ""The plane was in the sky"" - This establishes the main subject (the plane) and its location (the sky).
2. ""and it was fast"" - This is a coordinating clause that provides additional information about something being fast.

Given the sentence structure, ""it"" is more likely to refer to the main subject of the sentence, which is ""the plane."" This makes logical sense because:

a) Planes are typically described as fast, while the sky is not usually described in terms of speed.
b) The pronoun ""it"" is commonly used to refer to the main subject of a sentence when no other subject has been introduced.

2. ""and it was cloudy"" - This is a coordinating conjunction followed by another clause.

The pronoun ""it"" in the second clause is more likely to refer to the sky rather than the plane because:

1. ""Cloudy"" is an adjective typically used to describe weather conditions or the sky's appearance.
2. It would be unusual to say ""the plane was cloudy.""
3. The sentence is describing the setting (sky) and the weather condition (cloudy), which are naturally related.

1. The sentence states that ""Joe crashed into Mike.""
2. It then says ""he had to pay for the damage.""

In most cases, the person responsible for causing an accident is typically the one who has to pay for the damages. Since Joe is the one who crashed into Mike, it's logical to assume that Joe would be responsible for paying for the damage.

Therefore, ""he"" in this context most likely refers to Joe.",1,0
142,Joe crashed into Mike because he needed a place to sleep.,he,"0: Joe, 1: Mike, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and logic of the sentence.

The sentence states that ""Joe crashed into Mike because he needed a place to sleep."" The pronoun ""he"" is used in the explanation of why the crash occurred. 

Logically, the person who needs a place to sleep would be the one initiating the action of crashing into someone else. In this case, Joe is the subject of the sentence and the one performing the action of crashing into Mike.

Therefore, it makes more sense that ""he"" refers to Joe, as Joe would be the one needing a place to sleep, which led to him crashing into Mike.",0,0

1. The man shot his friend, and then the man (the shooter) died.
2. The man shot his friend, and then his friend (the one who was shot) died.

Given the context of a shooting, it's more likely that the person who was shot (the friend) died. However, this is not explicitly stated and relies on assumption.

144,The man shot his friend and he was arrested.,he,"0: The man, 1: his friend, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and logical flow:

1. The sentence has two parts: ""The man shot his friend"" and ""he was arrested.""
2. The pronoun ""he"" is the subject of the second part of the sentence.
3. In this context, it's more likely that the person who committed the shooting (the man) would be arrested, rather than the victim (his friend).

1. The sentence states that ""The man killed the boss because he hated the job.""
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause explaining the reason for the killing.
3. It's more logical that the person who committed the action (killing) would be the one who hated the job, rather than the victim.
4. Therefore, ""he"" most likely refers to ""The man"" who did the killing.
5. It wouldn't make sense for ""he"" to refer to ""the boss"" because the boss was killed and is not the one performing the action in the sentence.
6. The option ""Neither"" doesn't apply here because the pronoun clearly refers to one of the two mentioned individuals.

Based on this reasoning, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to ""The man"" (candidate 0).",0,0
146,The man killed the boss because he fired him.,he,"0: The man, 1: the boss, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and logical flow of the sentence.

1. The sentence states: ""The man killed the boss because he fired him.""
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause explaining the reason for the killing.
3. The action ""fired him"" suggests that the subject (""he"") had the authority to fire someone.
4. In a typical workplace hierarchy, a boss has the authority to fire employees, not the other way around.
5. Therefore, it's logical to conclude that ""he"" refers to ""the boss"" who fired ""the man.""

The pronoun ""he"" is used to avoid repeating ""the boss"" in the sentence, which is a common use of pronouns for clarity and conciseness.",1,1

The sentence states that ""Joe raced against Steven because he thought it would be easy."" The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause explaining the reason for the race. 

Logically, the person who initiates or participates in an action because they think it will be easy is more likely to be the subject of the sentence, which in this case is Joe. It makes more sense that Joe would race against Steven because Joe thought it would be easy, rather than Steven thinking it would be easy for Joe to race against him.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Joe.",0,0
148,Joe raced against Steven because he would not say no.,he,"0: Joe, 1: Steven, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" refers to one of the two people mentioned: Joe or Steven.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""because he would not say no.""
3. This implies that the person referred to by ""he"" is the one who wouldn't say no to racing.
4. The sentence structure suggests that Joe initiated the race against Steven because of this characteristic.

149,The light hit the mirror and it reflected.,it,"0: The light, 1: the mirror, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""it"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. ""The light hit the mirror"" - This is the main action of the sentence.
2. ""and it reflected"" - This is the second part of the sentence, describing what happened as a result of the first action.

The pronoun ""it"" is the subject of the verb ""reflected."" In this context, we need to consider which of the two objects (light or mirror) is more likely to reflect.

While light can be reflected, it's not typically described as the thing doing the reflecting. Instead, light is what gets reflected. On the other hand, mirrors are objects specifically designed to reflect light.

Therefore, it makes more sense for ""it"" to refer to ""the mirror"" rather than ""the light."" The mirror is the object that's doing the reflecting in this sentence.",0,1

1. ""The light hit the mirror and it shattered.""

2. In this sentence, we have two objects: the light and the mirror.

3. The pronoun ""it"" is used in the context of something shattering.

4. Logically, light cannot shatter. Light is a form of energy and doesn't have a physical form that can break into pieces.

152,Google Plus is expected to be a replacement for Facebook but it still has a lot more active users.,it,"0: Google Plus, 1: Facebook, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""it"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence compares Google Plus and Facebook.
2. The pronoun ""it"" is used in the second part of the sentence, after ""but"".
3. The phrase ""still has a lot more active users"" is more likely to refer to an established platform rather than a new one.
4. Facebook is known to be an established platform with a large user base.
5. The sentence implies that Google Plus is expected to replace Facebook, suggesting that Facebook is currently more popular.

Given these points, it's logical to conclude that ""it"" refers to Facebook. The sentence is saying that although Google Plus is expected to replace Facebook, Facebook still has many more active users.",1,1

1. The sentence states that ""The spear easily pierced through the armor because it was too sharp.""
2. The pronoun ""it"" is used to describe something that is ""too sharp.""
3. Between a spear and armor, a spear is typically sharp, while armor is not.
4. The sharpness of the spear would explain why it could easily pierce through the armor.
5. It wouldn't make sense for the armor to be described as ""too sharp,"" as that would not explain why the spear could pierce it easily.

Therefore, the pronoun ""it"" most likely refers to the spear, as the spear being ""too sharp"" explains why it could easily pierce the armor.",0,0
154,The spear easily pierced through the armor because it was too thin.,it,"0: The spear, 1: the armor, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""it"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and logic of the sentence:

1. The sentence states that ""The spear easily pierced through the armor because it was too thin.""
2. The pronoun ""it"" is used in the explanation of why the piercing occurred.
3. Logically, for a spear to easily pierce armor, the armor would need to be thin, not the spear.
4. If the spear were too thin, it would likely break or bend rather than pierce through armor.

In this sentence, the pronoun ""it"" is used to describe the subject that was clever, which led to the cat catching the mouse. Logically, being clever would be a trait that helps in catching prey, rather than being caught.

Therefore, ""it"" most likely refers to the cat, as the cat's cleverness would explain its success in catching the mouse. It wouldn't make sense for the mouse's cleverness to result in it being caught.

1. The sentence states that ""Joseph did not defeat William in the match.""
2. This is followed by ""so he paid $100.""

The use of ""so"" indicates a consequence of the previous action. In this case, the consequence of losing or not winning the match is paying $100. 

Since Joseph did not defeat William, it's logical to conclude that Joseph lost or did not win the match. Therefore, Joseph would be the one to face the consequence of paying $100.

The pronoun ""he"" is most likely referring to Joseph, as he is the one who would logically pay as a result of not winning the match.",0,0

Logically, the person who did not win (i.e., the one who was defeated) would be the one to earn the consolation prize of $100. Since Joseph did not defeat William, it implies that William defeated Joseph.

Therefore, ""he"" in this context most likely refers to Joseph, as he is the one who did not win and would thus be the one to earn the consolation prize.",1,0
159,"Adam failed to kill Alexander, so he hired a bodygaurd in case of a second attempt.",he,"0: Adam, 1: Alexander, 2: Neither","To determine who ""he"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and logical flow of events:

1. Adam failed to kill Alexander.
2. As a result, someone hired a bodyguard.
3. The bodyguard was hired in case of a second attempt.

Given this sequence, it's most logical that Alexander would be the one hiring a bodyguard. He was the target of the initial assassination attempt, so he would be the one concerned about a potential second attempt.

Adam, being the one who failed in the assassination attempt, would have no reason to hire a bodyguard for himself.

Therefore, ""he"" in this context most likely refers to Alexander.",1,1
160,"Adam failed to kill Alexander, so he hired an assassin for the second attempt.",he,"0: Adam, 1: Alexander, 2: Neither","To determine who ""he"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and logical flow of the events described.

1. The sentence starts with ""Adam failed to kill Alexander.""
2. This is followed by ""so he hired an assassin for the second attempt.""

The pronoun ""he"" is most likely referring to Adam for the following reasons:

1. Adam is the subject of the first clause and the main actor in the sentence.
2. The action of hiring an assassin is a continuation of the initial attempt to kill Alexander.
3. It wouldn't make sense for Alexander (the target) to hire an assassin for a second attempt on his own life.
4. The phrase ""second attempt"" implies that the same person who made the first attempt (Adam) is making another attempt.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Adam.",0,0
161,"The bowl had a crack, so it was filled in.",it,"0: The bowl, 1: a crack, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""it"" refers to ""The bowl"" for the following reasons:

1. The bowl is the main subject of the sentence.
2. The crack is described as being a part of the bowl.
3. The action of being ""filled in"" logically applies to the bowl, not the crack itself.

The sentence implies that the bowl had a crack, and this crack in the bowl was filled in. It wouldn't make sense to say that the crack itself was filled in, as cracks are typically filled, not filled in. The bowl, being the container, is what would be filled in to repair the crack.

Therefore, ""it"" in this context refers to ""The bowl"".",1,0
162,"The bowl had a crack, so it was thrown away.",it,"0: The bowl, 1: a crack, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""it"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. ""The bowl"" is the subject of the first clause.
2. ""a crack"" is part of a prepositional phrase describing the bowl.
3. ""it"" is the subject of the second clause.

In this sentence, ""it"" most likely refers to ""The bowl"" because:
- ""The bowl"" is the main subject of the sentence.
- The sentence is describing an action taken with the bowl (throwing it away) due to its condition (having a crack).
- It's more logical to throw away a bowl with a crack than to throw away the crack itself.

Therefore, ""it"" refers to ""The bowl"" (candidate 0).",0,0
163,The student told the instructor that he was sick.,he,"0: The student, 1: the instructor, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" could refer to either the student or the instructor, as both are male singular nouns. However, given the context, it's more likely that ""he"" refers to the student. The sentence structure suggests that the student is reporting their own condition to the instructor. It's more common for a student to inform an instructor about their own illness rather than the instructor's illness. Therefore, the most probable interpretation is that the student told the instructor that the student (himself) was sick.",0,0
164,The student told the instructor that he talked fast.,he,"0: The student, 1: the instructor, 2: Neither","To determine who the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence is about the student telling something to the instructor.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""he talked fast.""
3. Logically, the student is more likely to be commenting on the instructor's speaking speed rather than their own.
4. It would be unusual for the student to tell the instructor about their own speaking speed.
5. The most natural interpretation is that the student is informing the instructor about the instructor's fast talking.

Based on this reasoning, it's more likely that ""he"" refers to the instructor rather than the student.",1,1
165,Joe put Bob in the time machine and he went to the future.,he,"0: Joe, 1: Bob, 2: Neither","To determine who ""he"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and the most likely subject of the action.

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" is the subject of the second part of the sentence (""he went to the future"").
2. Joe is mentioned first and is the subject of the first action (""Joe put Bob in the time machine"").
3. Bob is the object of the first action, being put into the time machine by Joe.
4. Given that Joe is the one operating the time machine, it's more likely that he would be the one to go to the future.
5. There's no clear indication that a third party is involved, so option 2 (Neither) is unlikely.

Based on these points, it's more probable that ""he"" refers to Joe. Joe is the active agent in the first part of the sentence, and it would be a natural continuation for him to be the one who travels to the future after putting Bob in the time machine.",1,0
166,Joe put Bob in the time machine and he created another one.,he,"0: Joe, 1: Bob, 2: Neither","To determine who ""he"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and the actions described:

1. Joe is the subject of the first part of the sentence, performing the action of putting Bob in the time machine.
2. The second part of the sentence, ""he created another one,"" describes a new action.
3. The pronoun ""he"" is more likely to refer to the subject of the previous clause (Joe) rather than the object (Bob).
4. Creating another time machine implies that the person has the knowledge and ability to do so. Since Joe was the one operating the time machine in the first place, it's more logical that he would be the one to create another.

Based on these points, it's more likely that ""he"" refers to Joe rather than Bob.",0,0
167,Bill asked Joe if he could borrow some money.,he,"0: Bill, 1: Joe, 2: Neither","To determine who ""he"" refers to in this sentence, we need to consider the context and the most logical interpretation:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" is asking to borrow money.
2. Bill is the subject of the main clause, and he is asking Joe something.
3. It's more likely that Bill is asking Joe if Bill (himself) could borrow money, rather than Bill asking Joe if Joe could borrow money.
4. In English, it's common for the pronoun to refer to the subject of the main clause when there's ambiguity.

Given these points, it's most logical to conclude that ""he"" refers to Bill. Bill is asking Joe if Bill (he) could borrow some money from Joe.",0,0
168,Bill asked Joe if he had any money.,he,"0: Bill, 1: Joe, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence structure is: [Subject 1] asked [Subject 2] if [pronoun] had any money.
2. ""Bill"" is Subject 1, and ""Joe"" is Subject 2.
3. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the subordinate clause, which is part of the question Bill is asking Joe.
4. In this context, it's more likely that Bill is asking Joe about Joe's own money, rather than asking Joe about Bill's money.

1. The sentence describes an action where ""The chef"" is holding ""the waiter"" for a specific purpose.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""so that he would not flee.""
3. The act of fleeing implies that someone is being restrained or prevented from leaving.
4. Given that the chef is holding the waiter, it's logical to conclude that the waiter is the one being prevented from fleeing.
5. Therefore, ""he"" in this context refers to ""the waiter"" rather than ""the chef.""

2. The purpose is stated as ""so that he did not fall off.""
3. The pronoun ""he"" is used in reference to the person who might fall off.
4. Given the context, it's more logical that the waiter is the one at risk of falling, and the chef is preventing this by holding them.

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" is the subject of the clause ""wanted to help.""
2. The pronoun ""he"" is more likely to refer to the subject of the main clause (Tony) rather than the object (Jeff).
3. The sentence implies that Tony's action of helping Jeff was motivated by his own desire to help.
4. It would be less common for the sentence to mean that Tony helped Jeff because Jeff wanted to help (as this would be a somewhat unclear way to express that idea).

Given these points, it's most logical to conclude that ""he"" refers to Tony. Tony is the one who helped Jeff, and the reason given is that ""he"" (Tony) wanted to help.",0,0
172,Tony helped Jeff because he needed help.,he,"0: Tony, 1: Jeff, 2: Neither","To determine who the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" refers to the person who needed help.
2. The action in the sentence is ""Tony helped Jeff.""
3. Since Tony is the one providing help, it's logical to assume that Jeff is the one who needed help.

1. The sentence describes a relationship between a cat and a dog.
2. The pronoun ""it"" is used in the clause ""because it was scary.""
3. The word ""scary"" is an adjective that describes something frightening or intimidating.
4. In the context of the sentence, the cat is described as being afraid of the dog.
5. The reason for the cat's fear is that ""it was scary.""
6. Logically, the thing that is scary is the cause of the cat's fear.
7. Therefore, ""it"" must refer to the dog, as the dog is the entity causing fear in the cat.

Based on this reasoning, the pronoun ""it"" refers to ""the dog.""",1,1
174,The cat was afraid of the dog because it was timid.,it,"0: The cat, 1: the dog, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""it"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence describes two animals: a cat and a dog.
2. The pronoun ""it"" is used in the clause ""because it was timid.""
3. The sentence states that ""The cat was afraid of the dog because it was timid.""
4. Logically, the timidity is the reason for the cat's fear.
5. It makes more sense that the cat is timid, which causes it to be afraid of the dog.
6. If the dog were timid, it would be less likely to cause fear in the cat.

175,The violin fell off the table because someone knocked it off.,it,"0: The violin, 1: the table, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""it"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence is about the violin falling off the table.
2. The pronoun ""it"" is used in the phrase ""knocked it off.""
3. Logically, the object that was knocked off is the same object that fell.
4. The violin is the object that fell off the table.

Therefore, ""it"" most likely refers to ""the violin"" rather than ""the table."" It wouldn't make sense for someone to knock the table off itself, but it does make sense for someone to knock the violin off the table.",0,0
176,The violin fell off the table because it was unstable.,it,"0: The violin, 1: the table, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""it"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence and its context:

1. The sentence describes two objects: the violin and the table.
2. The pronoun ""it"" is used in the clause ""because it was unstable.""
3. The instability is the reason for the violin falling off the table.

Logically, the unstable object would be the table, not the violin. A stable table would prevent objects from falling off it. The violin's stability is not relevant to it falling off the table.

Therefore, ""it"" most likely refers to ""the table"" (candidate 1) because the table's instability caused the violin to fall.",1,1

3. Amber is the recipient of the hug.
4. The pronoun ""she"" is used in conjunction with ""was sad,"" indicating the emotional state of one of the individuals.
5. It's more logical that Lily gave Amber a hug because Amber was sad, rather than Lily hugging Amber because Lily herself was sad.

Based on this reasoning, it's more likely that ""she"" refers to Amber. The hug is a comforting gesture given to someone who is sad, which in this case appears to be Amber.",1,1
178,Lily gave Amber a hug because she was sorry.,she,"0: Lily, 1: Amber, 2: Neither","To determine who ""she"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and the most logical interpretation:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""she"" is the subject of the clause ""because she was sorry.""
2. The action described is Lily giving Amber a hug.
3. The reason for the hug is that ""she was sorry.""

It's more likely that the person giving the hug (Lily) is the one who is sorry, rather than the person receiving the hug (Amber). When someone is sorry, they often initiate an apologetic gesture like giving a hug.

Therefore, it's most logical to conclude that ""she"" refers to Lily, as Lily is the one who gave the hug, presumably as an act of apology.",0,0
179,The birds ate the seeds because they were hungry.,they,"0: The birds, 1: the seeds, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence logically:

1. The sentence states: ""The birds ate the seeds because they were hungry.""
2. The pronoun ""they"" is used to explain the reason for an action.
3. The action in the sentence is ""ate,"" performed by ""The birds.""
4. Being hungry is a characteristic that can explain why someone or something would eat.
5. Birds can feel hunger, while seeds cannot.
6. Therefore, ""they"" must refer to ""The birds"" as they are the ones who were hungry and performed the action of eating.

2. ""because they were tasty"" is the dependent clause explaining why the action occurred.

The pronoun ""they"" is used in the dependent clause to describe something that is ""tasty."" In this context, it's more logical that the seeds would be described as tasty rather than the birds. Birds are not typically described as tasty in the context of them eating something.

Therefore, ""they"" most likely refers to ""the seeds"" (candidate 1) because seeds can be tasty, which would explain why the birds ate them.",1,1

1. The sentence starts with ""Josie did not like Sarah""
2. Then it says ""but she did not know it""

The pronoun ""she"" is more likely to refer to Josie for the following reasons:
1. Josie is the subject of the first clause, making her the more prominent character in the sentence.
2. The sentence structure suggests that ""she"" is unaware of her own feelings towards Sarah.
3. It would be less logical for Sarah to not know that Josie didn't like her, as the sentence is focused on Josie's feelings.

1. The sentence starts with ""Josie did not like Sarah""
2. Then it says ""but she did not tell her""

The pronoun ""she"" is more likely to refer to Josie for the following reasons:
1. Josie is the subject of the first clause and is mentioned first, making her the more prominent character in the sentence.
2. The sentence structure implies that ""she"" (the subject of the second clause) is contrasting with the action in the first clause. Since Josie is the implied subject of ""did not like"" in the first clause, it's logical that she would also be the subject of ""did not tell"" in the second clause.
3. The use of ""her"" at the end of the sentence likely refers to Sarah, further supporting that ""she"" refers to Josie.

1. The sentence describes Ken trying to sneak past the boss.
2. The reason given for this action is that ""he was late for work.""

It's more logical that Ken would be the one who is late for work, rather than the boss. The act of sneaking past the boss implies that Ken is trying to avoid being noticed or confronted about his tardiness.

If the boss were late for work, there would be no need for Ken to sneak past him. Additionally, employees typically try to avoid their bosses when they're late, not the other way around.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Ken.",0,0

1. The sentence describes Ken trying to sneak past the boss.
2. The reason for this action is given after ""because"": ""he was looking for late people.""
3. It's more logical that the boss would be looking for late people, as this is typically a managerial responsibility.

185,The hyenas scavenged from the lions because they were desperate.,they,"0: The hyenas, 1: the lions, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and meaning of the sentence:

1. The sentence describes a situation where hyenas are scavenging from lions.

3. Logically, the act of scavenging is typically associated with desperation or hunger.
4. Hyenas are known to be scavengers in nature, while lions are primarily predators.
5. The sentence structure suggests that the reason for the hyenas' action (scavenging) is explained by the clause containing ""they.""

Based on these points, it is most logical to conclude that ""they"" refers to the hyenas. The hyenas are the ones performing the action of scavenging, which is likely due to their desperation. Lions, being at the top of the food chain, are less likely to be described as desperate in this context.",0,0
186,The hyenas scavenged from the lions because they had left scraps.,they,"0: The hyenas, 1: the lions, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and logic of the sentence:

1. The sentence describes a situation where hyenas are scavenging from lions.
2. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the clause ""because they had left scraps.""
3. Logically, the ones who would leave scraps after eating would be the lions, not the hyenas.
4. Hyenas are known to be scavengers, often feeding on leftovers from other predators' kills.
5. The sentence implies that the hyenas are taking advantage of the scraps left behind by another animal.

187,The fisherman hooked a big fish but he got away.,he,"0: The fisherman, 1: a big fish, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and consider the most logical interpretation:

1. ""The fisherman"" (candidate 0):
   - This is a human, typically referred to as ""he.""

   - Fish are often referred to as ""it,"" but can sometimes be personified as ""he.""
   - In fishing contexts, it's common to refer to a fish (especially a big one) as ""he.""
   - The phrase ""got away"" is typically used to describe a fish escaping after being hooked.

Given this analysis, it's more logical and common in fishing narratives for ""he"" to refer to the fish that was hooked and then escaped. The phrase ""he got away"" is a standard expression used when a fish escapes from a fisherman's hook.",1,"1

3. Animate vs. inanimate: ""He"" typically refers to a person (animate), which matches ""The fisherman"" but not ""a big fish"" (inanimate).

4. Gender agreement: ""He"" is a masculine pronoun, which aligns with the typical gender association of ""fisherman"" (although it's important to note that not all fishermen are male).

3. Logically, someone would hire a person because that person is a hard worker, not because the hirer themselves is a hard worker.
4. Therefore, ""he"" most likely refers to Jose, as Jose's work ethic is the reason for Steve hiring him.

Based on this reasoning, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Jose.",1,1
198,Steve hired Jose because he could not find anyone better.,he,"0: Steve, 1: Jose, 2: Neither","To determine who ""he"" refers to in this sentence, we need to consider the context and logical flow:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" is the subject who couldn't find anyone better.
2. The action of hiring is performed by Steve, indicating he was the one looking for someone to hire.
3. Jose is the person being hired, so he's not likely to be the one searching for candidates.
4. The pronoun ""he"" logically refers to Steve, as he would be the one unable to find a better candidate, leading to his decision to hire Jose.

Therefore, ""he"" most likely refers to Steve in this context.",0,0
199,"The outlaw shot the sheriff, but he did not shoot the deputy.",he,"0: The outlaw, 1: the sheriff, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence has two parts connected by ""but"":
   - ""The outlaw shot the sheriff""
   - ""he did not shoot the deputy""

2. The pronoun ""he"" is the subject of the second part of the sentence.

3. The use of ""but"" suggests a contrast between the two actions, implying that the same person is being referred to in both parts.

4. In the first part, ""The outlaw"" is the subject (the one performing the action of shooting), while ""the sheriff"" is the object (the one being shot).

5. Given that ""he"" is performing an action (not shooting) in the second part, it logically refers to the subject of the first part, which is ""The outlaw.""

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to ""The outlaw"" (candidate 0).",0,0
200,"The outlaw shot the sheriff, but he shot back.",he,"0: The outlaw, 1: the sheriff, 2: Neither","To determine who ""he"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and the logical flow of events:

1. The first part of the sentence states ""The outlaw shot the sheriff"".
2. The second part, connected by ""but"", says ""he shot back"".

The use of ""but"" indicates a contrast or opposition to the first action. This suggests that the person shooting back is different from the initial shooter (the outlaw).

""Shot back"" implies a response to being shot at. Since the sheriff was the one initially shot at, it makes the most sense that the sheriff would be the one to shoot back.

Therefore, ""he"" in this context most likely refers to the sheriff.",1,1
201,"Kelly neglected to tell Katie that their rent was due, but she told her later.",she,"0: Kelly, 1: Katie, 2: Neither","To determine who ""she"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and the actions described:

1. Kelly neglected to tell Katie about the rent being due.
2. ""She"" told ""her"" later.

The pronoun ""she"" is likely referring to Kelly because:
1. Kelly is the subject of the first clause and the one who initially failed to inform Katie.
2. The sentence structure suggests a contrast or correction of the initial action. Kelly first neglected to tell Katie, but then later did inform her.
3. It would be redundant and illogical for Katie to tell herself about the rent.

Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Kelly, who corrected her initial oversight by informing Katie later.",0,0
202,"Kelly neglected to tell Katie that their rent was due, but she remembered that it was due on the first of every month.",she,"0: Kelly, 1: Katie, 2: Neither","To determine who ""she"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and the actions described:

1. Kelly neglected to tell Katie about the rent being due.
2. ""She"" remembered that the rent was due on the first of every month.

The pronoun ""she"" is more likely to refer to Katie in this context because:

1. If Kelly had remembered about the rent, she probably wouldn't have neglected to tell Katie about it.
2. The sentence structure suggests that ""she"" is contrasting with Kelly's action of neglecting to inform Katie.
3. The fact that ""she"" remembered implies that this person had the correct information despite not being told, which fits Katie's situation better than Kelly's.

Therefore, it's most logical to conclude that ""she"" refers to Katie.",1,1
203,"The committee increased the price of the tickets to the dance for the students, but they did not like it.",they,"0: The committee, 1: the students, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and meaning of the sentence:

1. The committee increased the price of the tickets.
2. The tickets were for the dance for the students.
3. ""They"" did not like it (the price increase).

Given this information, it's more logical that the students would be the ones who didn't like the price increase, rather than the committee who implemented it. The committee is the active party making the decision, while the students are the affected party.

Additionally, ""they"" is used in contrast to ""The committee"" at the beginning of the sentence, suggesting a shift in subject to the other group mentioned - the students.

Therefore, the pronoun ""they"" most likely refers to ""the students.""",1,1
204,"The committee increased the price of the tickets to the dance for the students, but they changed their decision later.",they,"0: The committee, 1: the students, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and grammatical structure of the sentence:

1. The sentence has two main parts:
   - ""The committee increased the price of the tickets to the dance for the students""
   - ""but they changed their decision later""

2. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the second part of the sentence, referring to the subject that changed the decision.

3. The committee is the main subject of the first part of the sentence and the entity responsible for increasing the price of the tickets.

4. It logically follows that the committee would be the entity with the power to change the decision about the price increase.

5. The students are mentioned as the recipients of the action (the price increase affects them) but are not described as having any decision-making power in this context.

Given these points, it is most logical and grammatically consistent that ""they"" refers to ""The committee"" rather than ""the students.""",0,0
205,John wanted George to run for President because he was a great governor.,he,"0: John, 1: George, 2: Neither","To determine who ""he"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and logical flow:

1. John is the subject of the main clause, wanting George to run for President.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the subordinate clause, describing someone as ""a great governor.""
3. The fact that someone was ""a great governor"" is given as the reason for John wanting them to run for President.
4. It's more logical that John would want George to run for President because George (not John himself) was a great governor.
5. Therefore, ""he"" most likely refers to George, as it provides the explanation for why John wanted George to run.

Based on this reasoning, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to George.",1,1
206,John wanted George to run for President because he did not want to.,he,"0: John, 1: George, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. John wanted George to run for President.
2. The reason given is that ""he did not want to.""

The pronoun ""he"" in this case is more likely to refer to John because:

1. John is the subject of the main clause and the one expressing the desire for George to run.
2. The sentence implies that the person referred to by ""he"" doesn't want to run for President.
3. If John wants George to run, it logically follows that John himself doesn't want to run.

It wouldn't make sense for ""he"" to refer to George because if George didn't want to run, there would be no need for John to want him to run.

Therefore, ""he"" most likely refers to John.",0,0
207,"Olivia wants to make amends with Emily, but she is apprehensive.",she,"0: Olivia, 1: Emily, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Olivia for the following reasons:

1. Olivia is the subject of the main clause and the primary actor in the sentence.
2. The sentence structure suggests that the person who ""wants to make amends"" is the same person who ""is apprehensive.""
3. It's more logical that the person initiating the action (making amends) would be the one feeling apprehensive about it.
4. Olivia is mentioned first in the sentence, making her the more prominent subject and thus more likely to be referred to by the pronoun.

While it's not impossible that ""she"" could refer to Emily, the sentence structure and context make it much more likely that it refers to Olivia.",0,0
208,"Olivia wants to make amends with Emily, but she no longer wants to be friends.",she,"0: Olivia, 1: Emily, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Olivia wants to make amends with Emily.""
2. The second part of the sentence, connected by ""but,"" introduces new information about one of the subjects.
3. The pronoun ""she"" is used in this second part.
4. Logically, the person who ""no longer wants to be friends"" is more likely to be the one initiating the action of making amends.

Given this analysis, it's more probable that ""she"" refers to Olivia. Olivia is the subject of the first clause and the one taking action (wanting to make amends). It makes more sense that Olivia is the one who no longer wants to be friends, yet still wants to make amends, possibly to clear the air or resolve any lingering issues without continuing the friendship.",1,0
209,"Jill saw Jane fall down, and she helped her up.",she,"0: Jill, 1: Jane, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Jill saw Jane fall down.
2. ""She"" helped ""her"" up.

The pronoun ""she"" is the subject of the second part of the sentence, performing the action of helping. Given the sequence of events, it's logical that the person who saw someone fall would be the one to help them up. Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Jill, who witnessed Jane falling and then helped her up.

The pronoun ""her"" in this context refers to Jane, who fell down and was helped up.

Based on this reasoning, we can conclude that ""she"" refers to Jill.",0,0
210,"Jill saw Jane fall down, and she asked her for help.",she,"0: Jill, 1: Jane, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Jill saw Jane fall down.
2. ""She"" asked ""her"" for help.

Given this information, it's more logical that ""she"" refers to Jill, not Jane. Here's why:

- Jane is the one who fell down, so she's likely the one in need of help.
- It wouldn't make sense for Jane (who fell) to ask for help from Jill.
- It's more reasonable that Jill, who witnessed Jane falling, would ask Jane if she needs help.

Therefore, ""she"" in this context most likely refers to Jill (candidate 0).",1,0
211,"Larry purchased some of Marty's Lemonade, and he made money.",he,"0: Larry, 1: Marty, 2: Neither","To determine who ""he"" refers to in this sentence, we need to consider the context and logical flow of the statement.

1. Larry purchased some of Marty's Lemonade: This establishes that Larry is the buyer and Marty is the seller.
2. ""he made money"": This is the key part of the sentence that helps us identify who ""he"" refers to.

In a typical business transaction, the seller is the one who makes money from a sale, not the buyer. Therefore, it's more logical to conclude that ""he"" refers to Marty, who would have made money from selling his lemonade to Larry.

Larry, as the buyer, would have spent money rather than made money in this transaction.

Based on this reasoning, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Marty.",1,1
212,"Larry purchased some of Marty's Lemonade, and he wanted the recipe.",he,"0: Larry, 1: Marty, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Larry. The reasoning is as follows:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" is the subject of the second clause, which is connected to the first clause by ""and"".
2. Larry is the subject of the first clause, making him the most recent and prominent subject in the sentence.
3. The action of wanting the recipe logically follows the action of purchasing the lemonade, which Larry did.
4. It makes more sense for Larry (the customer) to want the recipe after tasting the lemonade, rather than Marty (the seller) who presumably already knows the recipe.

Therefore, based on the context and logical flow of the sentence, ""he"" most likely refers to Larry.",0,0
213,The professor gave the student a bad grade because he did not study.,he,"0: The professor, 1: the student, 2: Neither","To determine who ""he"" refers to in this sentence, we need to consider the context and logical flow of the statement.

1. The sentence structure suggests that the reason for the bad grade is explained after ""because"".
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the explanation for the bad grade.
3. It's more logical that a student would receive a bad grade for not studying, rather than a professor giving a bad grade because the professor didn't study.
4. Therefore, ""he"" most likely refers to the student, not the professor.

Based on this reasoning, the pronoun ""he"" refers to the student.",1,1
214,The professor gave the student a bad grade because he was strict.,he,"0: The professor, 1: the student, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and logic of the sentence:

1. The sentence describes a situation where a professor gave a student a bad grade.
2. The reason given for this action is that ""he was strict.""
3. Being strict is typically a characteristic associated with authority figures or those in positions of power.
4. In this context, the professor is the one in the position of authority and the one giving grades.
5. It's more logical that the professor's strictness would lead to giving a bad grade, rather than the student's strictness causing them to receive a bad grade.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to the professor, as it makes the most sense in the context of the sentence.",0,0
215,We took the books to the shops because they were old.,they,"0: the books, 1: the shops, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence and its context:

1. ""We took the books to the shops because they were old.""

The pronoun ""they"" is used to refer to something that is described as ""old"" in this sentence. Let's consider each candidate:

0. the books: Books can become old over time, and it's common to take old books to shops (possibly second-hand bookstores or for recycling/donation).
1. the shops: While shops can be old, it doesn't make sense in this context to take books to shops because the shops are old.
2. Neither: The pronoun clearly refers to something mentioned in the sentence, so this option can be ruled out.

Given the context and logical interpretation, ""they"" most likely refers to ""the books."" It makes sense that books would be taken to shops (possibly to sell or donate) because the books were old.",0,0
216,We took the books to the shops because they would buy them.,they,"0: the books, 1: the shops, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. The pronoun ""they"" is plural, so it must refer to a plural noun in the sentence.
2. We have two potential candidates: ""the books"" and ""the shops"".
3. Both ""the books"" and ""the shops"" are plural, so grammatically, either could be the referent.
4. However, the sentence states that ""they would buy them"".
5. Books don't typically buy things, but shops (or more accurately, the people who run shops) do buy things.
6. The ""them"" at the end of the sentence likely refers to ""the books"".

Given this reasoning, it makes more sense for ""they"" to refer to ""the shops"" as shops are the entities that would buy books.",1,1
217,We gave the fruit to the humans because they were hungry.,they,"0: the fruit, 1: the humans, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, let's analyze the sentence:

""We gave the fruit to the humans because they were hungry.""

1. ""They"" is a plural pronoun, so it must refer to a plural noun.
2. ""The fruit"" is singular, so it cannot be the referent of ""they.""
3. ""The humans"" is plural and matches the pronoun ""they"" in number.
4. The sentence implies that the humans were hungry, which is why they were given the fruit.

Based on these observations, it's clear that ""they"" refers to ""the humans"" in this sentence. The pronoun is used to avoid repeating ""the humans"" in the second part of the sentence.",1,1
218,We gave the fruit to the humans because they were ripe.,they,"0: the fruit, 1: the humans, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine what ""they"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. ""We gave the fruit to the humans"" - This is the main action of the sentence.
2. ""because they were ripe"" - This is the reason for the action.

The pronoun ""they"" is most likely referring to ""the fruit"" for the following reasons:
1. Ripeness is a characteristic typically associated with fruit, not humans.
2. The sentence structure suggests that the reason for giving the fruit to the humans is that ""they"" (the fruit) were ripe.
3. It wouldn't make logical sense to give fruit to humans because the humans were ripe.

The sentence structure suggests a comparison between Battlefield 3 and Modern Warfare 3, with the conclusion that Battlefield 3 is more fun. The pronoun ""it"" is used in the latter part of the sentence to refer back to the subject of the comparison, which is Battlefield 3. The statement ""it is a better game"" is given as the reason why Battlefield 3 is more fun, further confirming that ""it"" refers to Battlefield 3.",0,0
220,Battlefield 3 is more fun than Modern Warfare 3 because it is a crappy game.,it,"0: Battlefield 3, 1: Modern Warfare 3, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""it"" most likely refers to Modern Warfare 3. The structure of the sentence suggests that the speaker is comparing Battlefield 3 to Modern Warfare 3, and then provides a reason why Battlefield 3 is more fun. The phrase ""because it is a crappy game"" is giving the reason, and logically, this would be referring to Modern Warfare 3. It wouldn't make sense for the speaker to say Battlefield 3 is more fun because Battlefield 3 is a crappy game. Therefore, ""it"" in this context is referring to Modern Warfare 3.",1,1
221,John attacked Tim because he hates communists.,he,"0: John, 1: Tim, 2: Neither","To determine who ""he"" refers to in this sentence, we need to consider the context and logical flow of the statement.

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" is the reason for John's action of attacking Tim.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is followed by ""hates communists,"" which provides the motivation for the attack.
3. It's more likely that the attacker (John) would have a strong opinion or hatred that motivates his action, rather than the victim (Tim).
4. If Tim hated communists, it wouldn't explain why John attacked him.

Therefore, it's most logical to conclude that ""he"" refers to John, as John's hatred for communists is presented as the reason for his attack on Tim.",0,0
222,John attacked Tim because he was a communist.,he,"0: John, 1: Tim, 2: Neither","To determine who ""he"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and logical flow:

3. The phrase ""because he was a communist"" provides the motivation for the attack.
4. It's more likely that John would attack Tim for being a communist, rather than John attacking Tim because John himself was a communist.

Given this reasoning, it's most logical to conclude that ""he"" refers to Tim (candidate 1). The sentence is explaining that John attacked Tim because Tim was a communist.",1,1
223,Someone hit Billy in the face because he was angry.,he,"0: Someone, 1: Billy, 2: Neither","To determine who ""he"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and logical flow of the statement.

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" refers to the person who was angry, which led to someone hitting Billy.
2. It's more likely that the person doing the hitting was angry, rather than Billy being angry and getting hit as a result.
3. ""Someone"" is the subject of the sentence and the one performing the action (hitting), which aligns with them being the angry party.
4. It wouldn't make sense for Billy to be angry and then get hit as a consequence of his own anger.

224,Someone hit Billy in the face because he was being rude.,he,"0: Someone, 1: Billy, 2: Neither","To determine who the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence states that ""Someone hit Billy in the face.""
2. The reason given for this action is ""because he was being rude.""

The pronoun ""he"" is more likely to refer to Billy for the following reasons:
1. It's more logical that Billy's rudeness would provoke someone to hit him, rather than the person doing the hitting being rude.
2. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" refers to the object of the first clause (Billy), not the subject (Someone).
3. It's uncommon to use ""he"" to refer to an indefinite pronoun like ""Someone.""

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Billy.",1,1
225,Joe has more money than Adam since he has a better job.,he,"0: Joe, 1: Adam, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence compares Joe and Adam in terms of their financial situation.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""he has a better job.""
3. This clause explains why one person has more money than the other.
4. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" refers to the person who has more money.
5. The first part of the sentence states that ""Joe has more money than Adam.""

Therefore, it's logical to conclude that ""he"" refers to Joe, as Joe is the one who has more money, which is explained by having a better job.",0,0
226,Joe has more money than Adam since he has no job.,he,"0: Joe, 1: Adam, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

""Joe has more money than Adam since he has no job.""

The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""he has no job."" This clause provides an explanation for why one person has more money than the other. 

Logically, having no job would typically result in having less money, not more. Therefore, ""he"" must refer to Adam, as the sentence states that Joe has more money than Adam, and the reason given is that ""he"" (Adam) has no job.

This interpretation makes the most sense in the context of the sentence, as it explains why Joe has more money than Adam.",1,1
227,Pigs are better than sheep because they make bacon.,they,"0: Pigs, 1: sheep, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" refers to ""Pigs"" for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure suggests that the subject (Pigs) is being compared to sheep.
2. The pronoun ""they"" is used to explain why pigs are better, which logically connects to the subject of the sentence.
3. The statement ""they make bacon"" is a characteristic associated with pigs, not sheep.

Therefore, ""they"" clearly refers to ""Pigs"" in this context.",0,0
228,Pigs are better than sheep because they do not make bacon.,they,"0: Pigs, 1: sheep, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" refers to sheep, not pigs. The sentence structure suggests that pigs are being compared favorably to sheep, and the reason given is that ""they do not make bacon."" Since pigs are well-known for producing bacon, it's clear that ""they"" must be referring to sheep, which do not produce bacon.",1,1
229,The car beat the bike because it was faster.,it,"0: The car, 1: the bike, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""it"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence states that ""The car beat the bike because it was faster.""
2. The pronoun ""it"" is used to explain why one vehicle beat the other.
3. In this context, being ""faster"" is the reason for winning.
4. Logically, the faster vehicle would be the one that won the race or competition.
5. The sentence explicitly states that ""The car beat the bike,"" indicating that the car was the winner.
6. Therefore, ""it"" must refer to the car, as the car is the one that was faster and consequently won.

230,The car beat the bike because it was too slow.,it,"0: The car, 1: the bike, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""it"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and logic of the sentence.

The sentence states that ""The car beat the bike because it was too slow."" 

Logically, the car winning a race or competition against a bike would be due to the bike being slow, not the car. If the car was too slow, it wouldn't have beaten the bike.

Therefore, ""it"" in this context refers to the bike, as the bike's slowness is the reason for the car's victory.",1,1
231,The blimp hit the tree because it lost air.,it,"0: The blimp, 1: the tree, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""it"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence logically:

1. The sentence states that ""The blimp hit the tree because it lost air.""
2. The pronoun ""it"" is used in the clause explaining why the collision occurred.
3. Between a blimp and a tree, only a blimp can lose air.
4. Trees don't contain air that can be lost, so ""it"" cannot refer to the tree.
5. The loss of air is presented as the cause of the blimp hitting the tree, which makes sense for a blimp but not for a tree.

Therefore, the pronoun ""it"" must refer to the blimp, as it is the only candidate that can logically lose air and cause the described situation.",0,0
232,The blimp hit the tree because it was in the way.,it,"0: The blimp, 1: the tree, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""it"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence logically:

1. The sentence states that ""The blimp hit the tree because it was in the way.""
2. The pronoun ""it"" is used in the explanation of why the collision occurred.
3. For something to be ""in the way,"" it typically means it's stationary or an obstacle.
4. Blimps are mobile and can change direction, while trees are stationary.
5. It's more logical that a stationary object (the tree) would be described as ""in the way"" rather than the moving object (the blimp).

Therefore, the pronoun ""it"" most likely refers to the tree, as the tree being ""in the way"" explains why the blimp hit it.",1,1
233,Bob sued Bill because he was embezzling funds.,he,"0: Bob, 1: Bill, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence structure is: ""Bob sued Bill because he was embezzling funds.""
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause explaining the reason for the lawsuit.
3. Logically, Bob would sue Bill if Bill was the one embezzling funds, not if Bob himself was doing it.
4. The act of embezzling funds is more likely to be associated with the person being sued (Bill) rather than the person initiating the lawsuit (Bob).

Based on this reasoning, it's more logical and probable that ""he"" refers to Bill, as Bill's embezzlement would be the reason for Bob to sue him.",1,1
234,Bob sued Bill because he wanted more money.,he,"0: Bob, 1: Bill, 2: Neither","To determine who ""he"" refers to in this sentence, we need to consider the context and logical flow of the statement.

1. The sentence structure is: ""Bob sued Bill because he wanted more money.""
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause explaining the reason for the lawsuit.
3. In a lawsuit, typically the person suing (the plaintiff) is the one seeking something, often money.
4. Bob is the subject of the sentence and the one doing the suing.
5. It's more logical that Bob, as the one suing, is the one who wants more money.
6. Bill, being sued, is less likely to be the one wanting more money in this context.

Therefore, it's most reasonable to conclude that ""he"" refers to Bob, as Bob is the one who initiated the lawsuit, likely because he (Bob) wanted more money.",0,0
235,I gave the donkey some food because it was hungry.,it,"0: some food, 1: the donkey, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. The pronoun ""it"" is used in the clause ""because it was hungry.""
2. We need to determine what ""it"" refers to.
3. The candidates are ""some food"" and ""the donkey.""
4. Logically, food cannot be hungry, as hunger is a feeling experienced by living beings.
5. A donkey, being an animal, can experience hunger.
6. The sentence structure suggests that the donkey was given food because of its hunger.

Therefore, ""it"" most likely refers to ""the donkey"" in this context.",1,1
236,I gave the donkey some food because it was fresh.,it,"0: some food, 1: the donkey, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. The pronoun ""it"" is referring to something in the sentence.
2. We have two main candidates: ""some food"" and ""the donkey"".

4. In this context, ""fresh"" is more likely to describe food rather than a donkey.
5. It wouldn't make sense to say ""I gave the donkey some food because the donkey was fresh.""

237,The humans were afraid of the robots because they were weak.,they,"0: The humans, 1: the robots, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence presents two groups: ""The humans"" and ""the robots"".
2. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the latter part of the sentence to describe a characteristic: ""were weak"".
3. The sentence structure suggests that the weakness is the reason for the humans' fear.
4. Logically, it makes more sense that the humans would be afraid of the robots if the humans themselves were weak, not if the robots were weak.
5. Therefore, ""they"" most likely refers to ""The humans"".

Based on this reasoning, the pronoun ""they"" refers to ""The humans"".",0,0
238,The humans were afraid of the robots because they were strong.,they,"0: The humans, 1: the robots, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence presents two groups: ""The humans"" and ""the robots"".
2. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the latter part of the sentence.
3. The sentence states that ""they were strong"".
4. Logically, robots are typically associated with strength, while humans being afraid of robots due to their strength makes more sense than humans being afraid of robots because humans themselves were strong.

Based on this analysis, it's most likely that ""they"" refers to ""the robots"". The sentence is explaining why the humans were afraid, and the robots' strength is a logical reason for this fear.",1,1
239,The Playstation is outperforming the Xbox because it has better games.,it,"0: The Playstation, 1: the Xbox, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""it"" refers to the Playstation. The sentence structure indicates that the Playstation is outperforming the Xbox, and then provides a reason for this performance difference. The phrase ""because it has better games"" is explaining why the Playstation is outperforming the Xbox. Therefore, ""it"" in this context is referring to the Playstation, which is the subject of the sentence and the console being described as having better games.",0,0
240,The Playstation is outperforming the Xbox because it is prone to hardware failure.,it,"0: The Playstation, 1: the Xbox, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""it"" refers to the Xbox, not the Playstation. The sentence structure suggests that the Playstation is outperforming the Xbox, and then provides a reason for this comparison. The phrase ""because it is prone to hardware failure"" is explaining why the Xbox is being outperformed, not describing the Playstation. Therefore, ""it"" in this context refers to the Xbox.",1,1
241,Sean is better than Watson at anaphora resolution because he can naturally understand natural language.,he,"0: Sean, 1: Watson, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Sean for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" is the subject of the clause ""can naturally understand natural language.""

2. This ability to naturally understand language is presented as the reason why Sean is better than Watson at anaphora resolution.

3. It would not make sense for ""he"" to refer to Watson in this context, as the sentence is comparing Sean favorably to Watson.

4. The pronoun ""he"" is typically used for male individuals, which aligns with the name Sean (typically a male name).

Therefore, the most logical referent for the pronoun ""he"" in this sentence is Sean.",0,0
242,Sean is better than Watson at anaphora resolution because he has trouble understanding natural language.,he,"0: Sean, 1: Watson, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. The pronoun ""he"" is singular and masculine, which could refer to either Sean or Watson, as both are typically male names.

2. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" refers to the subject that ""has trouble understanding natural language.""

3. The sentence states that ""Sean is better than Watson at anaphora resolution."" This implies that Sean has superior skills in this area.

4. The reason given for Sean being better is that ""he has trouble understanding natural language.""

5. Logically, if Sean is better, then the one having trouble understanding natural language must be Watson, not Sean.

Therefore, ""he"" in this context refers to Watson, as Watson is the one who has trouble understanding natural language, which makes Sean better at anaphora resolution.",1,1
243,Sentient machines will kill all humans because they have giant death rays.,they,"0: Sentient machines, 1: all humans, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence is about sentient machines and their actions towards humans.
2. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the clause ""because they have giant death rays.""
3. Logically, the subject possessing ""giant death rays"" would be the one capable of killing humans.
4. In this context, it makes more sense for sentient machines to have death rays rather than humans.

Therefore, ""they"" most likely refers to ""Sentient machines"" rather than ""all humans"" or neither option.",0,0
244,Sentient machines will kill all humans because they are inferior beings.,they,"0: Sentient machines, 1: all humans, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence is about sentient machines and their potential actions towards humans.
2. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the clause ""because they are inferior beings.""
3. Logically, it wouldn't make sense for sentient machines to consider themselves inferior beings.
4. The sentence implies that sentient machines view humans as inferior, which is why they would kill them.

Based on this analysis, ""they"" most likely refers to ""all humans"" because:
a) It's more logical for machines to view humans as inferior rather than themselves.
b) The sentence structure suggests that the reason for killing humans is their perceived inferiority.

Therefore, the pronoun ""they"" refers to ""all humans"" (candidate 1).",1,1
245,Watson beat Ken at Jeopardy because he is a superior machine.,he,"0: Watson, 1: Ken, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Watson. The reasoning is as follows:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" is the subject of the clause following ""because.""
2. The phrase ""superior machine"" is used to describe the subject of this clause.
3. Watson, being an AI system, is the only candidate that can be accurately described as a ""machine.""
4. Ken, being a human, cannot be referred to as a ""machine.""

Therefore, ""he"" in this context must be referring to Watson, as it aligns with the description of being a ""superior machine.""",0,0
246,Watson beat Ken at Jeopardy because he is an inferior human.,he,"0: Watson, 1: Ken, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and logic of the sentence:

1. The sentence compares Watson and Ken in the context of a Jeopardy game.
2. Watson is described as beating Ken.
3. The pronoun ""he"" is followed by ""is an inferior human.""
4. Watson is an artificial intelligence, not a human.
5. Ken is a human.

Given this information, it's logical to conclude that ""he"" refers to Ken. The sentence is explaining that Watson beat Ken because Ken is an inferior human (compared to the AI). It wouldn't make sense for ""he"" to refer to Watson, as Watson is not human.",1,1
247,Larry trusted Page because Bill told him to.,him,"0: Larry, 1: Page, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""him"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence has three people mentioned: Larry, Page, and Bill.
2. The pronoun ""him"" is used in the phrase ""Bill told him to.""
3. ""Him"" is the object of the verb ""told,"" so it refers to the person being told something by Bill.
4. The main subject of the sentence is Larry, who is trusting Page.
5. The sentence implies that Bill told Larry to trust Page.

Given this analysis, ""him"" most likely refers to Larry. It wouldn't make sense for Bill to tell Page to trust himself, and there's no indication of a fourth person being involved.",0,0
248,Larry trusted Page because Bill knows him.,him,"0: Larry, 1: Page, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""him"" refers to, let's analyze the sentence:

""Larry trusted Page because Bill knows him.""

1. The pronoun ""him"" is in the object position of the clause ""Bill knows him.""
2. ""Larry"" and ""Page"" are both mentioned earlier in the sentence.
3. The sentence structure suggests that ""him"" refers to someone that Bill knows, and this knowledge is the reason for Larry trusting Page.
4. It's more likely that ""him"" refers to ""Page"" rather than ""Larry"" because:
   a) If ""him"" referred to Larry, the sentence would imply that Larry trusts Page because Bill knows Larry, which doesn't make much logical sense.
   b) It's more natural to interpret the sentence as: Larry trusted Page because Bill knows Page.

Therefore, based on the context and logical flow of the sentence, ""him"" most likely refers to Page.",1,1

""Cosby supported Jay because Thea really liked him.""

1. The pronoun ""him"" is used in the object position of the sentence.
2. It refers to a male person.
3. The sentence structure suggests that ""him"" is the person Thea liked.
4. Logically, it makes more sense that Thea liked Jay, which is why Cosby supported him.
5. If ""him"" referred to Cosby, the sentence would imply that Cosby supported Jay because Thea liked Cosby, which doesn't make as much logical sense.

Therefore, the pronoun ""him"" most likely refers to Jay.",1,1
250,Cosby supported Jay because Thea asked him to.,him,"0: Cosby, 1: Jay, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""him"" refers to, let's analyze the sentence:

""Cosby supported Jay because Thea asked him to.""

1. The pronoun ""him"" is used in the object position of the sentence.
2. The sentence structure suggests that Thea asked someone to support Jay.
3. Logically, Thea would have asked Cosby to support Jay, not Jay to support himself.
4. ""Him"" cannot refer to Jay because it would not make sense in the context (Thea asking Jay to support Jay).
5. ""Him"" most likely refers to Cosby, as he is the one performing the action of supporting Jay.

Therefore, the pronoun ""him"" most likely refers to Cosby.",0,0
251,Jace loves Jesus because he died for him.,he,"0: Jace, 1: Jesus, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine whether the pronoun ""he"" refers to Jace, Jesus, or neither. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" is the subject of ""died for him.""
2. It's unlikely that Jace died for himself, so ""he"" is not referring to Jace.
3. The phrase ""died for him"" is commonly associated with Jesus' sacrifice in Christian theology.
4. It makes logical sense that Jesus would be the one who ""died for him"" (Jace).

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" in this sentence most likely refers to Jesus.",1,1
252,Jace loves Jesus because he tasted his goodness.,he,"0: Jace, 1: Jesus, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine whether the pronoun ""he"" refers to Jace or Jesus. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" is the subject of the second clause, while ""his"" refers to the object.
2. It's more likely that Jace, as the main subject of the sentence, is the one who ""tasted his goodness"" rather than Jesus tasting his own goodness.
3. The phrase ""tasted his goodness"" is often used metaphorically to describe experiencing God's or Jesus's benevolence, not as a literal action performed by Jesus.
4. Therefore, it makes more sense for ""he"" to refer to Jace, who is experiencing Jesus's goodness.

Based on this reasoning, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Jace.",0,0
253,Olga kicked Sara because she woke her up.,she,"0: Olga, 1: Sara, 2: Neither","To determine who ""she"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and logical flow:

1. The sentence states that ""Olga kicked Sara because she woke her up.""
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause explaining the reason for the kicking.
3. The action of waking someone up is typically done by someone else, not by oneself.
4. It's more logical that Sara woke Olga up, which then caused Olga to kick Sara.
5. Therefore, ""she"" in this context most likely refers to Sara, as Sara is the one who performed the action that led to the kicking.

Based on this reasoning, the pronoun ""she"" refers to Sara.",1,1
254,Olga kicked Sara because she was drunk.,she,"0: Olga, 1: Sara, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence states that ""Olga kicked Sara because she was drunk.""
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the explanation of why the kicking occurred.
3. Being drunk is typically associated with the person performing an action, rather than the recipient of the action.
4. In this case, Olga is the one performing the action (kicking), so it's more likely that ""she"" refers to Olga.
5. The sentence implies that the drunkenness was the reason for the kicking, which further supports that ""she"" refers to Olga.

Based on this reasoning, it's most logical to conclude that ""she"" refers to Olga, who was drunk and therefore kicked Sara.",0,0

1. The sentence starts with ""Nola shot Christina in the head.""
2. The reason given is ""because she threatened to take all of her money.""

The pronoun ""she"" in this context is more likely to refer to Christina for the following reasons:

1. It's more logical that Christina (the person who was shot) had threatened Nola, rather than Nola threatening herself.
2. The sentence structure suggests that the reason for the shooting comes after the action, and ""she"" refers to the person who made the threat, which is likely Christina.
3. It's unlikely that Nola would shoot Christina because Nola herself threatened to take money.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Christina.",1,1
256,Nola shot Christina in the head because she thought it was a good idea to kill a human being.,she,"0: Nola, 1: Christina, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""she thought it was a good idea to kill a human being."" This thought process is more likely to be attributed to the person doing the shooting (Nola) rather than the victim (Christina). 

The sentence structure suggests that Nola is the subject performing the action (shooting), and the pronoun ""she"" is used to refer back to Nola when describing her thought process. It wouldn't make sense for Christina, who is being shot, to think it was a good idea to kill a human being in this context.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Nola.",0,0
257,Rebecca kissed Dina because she loves her.,she,"0: Rebecca, 1: Dina, 2: Neither","To determine who ""she"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and the logical flow of the statement.

1. The sentence structure is: ""Rebecca kissed Dina because she loves her.""
2. The pronoun ""she"" is the subject of the clause ""she loves her.""
3. The action of kissing is typically initiated by the person who has romantic feelings.
4. Rebecca is the subject of the main clause and the one performing the action of kissing.
5. The word ""because"" indicates that the reason for the kiss follows, which is that ""she loves her.""

Given this analysis, it's most logical that ""she"" refers to Rebecca. Rebecca is the one who initiated the kiss, and the reason given is that she (Rebecca) loves her (Dina). It wouldn't make as much sense for Dina to be the subject of ""she loves her"" in this context, as Dina is not the one performing the action in the main clause.

258,Rebecca kissed Dina because she is a sweet girl.,she,"0: Rebecca, 1: Dina, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""she"" is the reason Rebecca kissed Dina.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is described as ""a sweet girl.""
3. Logically, the sweetness of the person being kissed (Dina) is more likely to be the reason for the kiss, rather than the sweetness of the person doing the kissing (Rebecca).
4. Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Dina, as Dina's sweetness is the probable reason for Rebecca's action.

Based on this reasoning, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Dina.",1,1
259,Mom brought Sara from school early because she was sick.,she,"0: Mom, 1: Sara, 2: Neither","To determine who ""she"" refers to in this sentence, we need to consider the context and logical implications:

1. The sentence states that ""Mom brought Sara from school early because she was sick.""
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause explaining why Sara was brought from school early.
3. It's more logical that a child would be brought home from school early due to illness, rather than a parent picking up their child because the parent was sick.
4. If Mom was sick, it would be unusual for her to go to school to pick up Sara.

Based on these considerations, it's most likely that ""she"" refers to Sara, as Sara being sick would be the reason for Mom to bring her home from school early.",1,1
260,Mom brought Sara from school early because she had an early meeting.,she,"0: Mom, 1: Sara, 2: Neither","To determine who ""she"" refers to in this sentence, we need to consider the context and logical flow of the statement.

1. The sentence states that ""Mom brought Sara from school early.""
2. The reason given is ""because she had an early meeting.""

Now, let's analyze who is more likely to have an early meeting:

- Mom: It's common for parents to have work commitments, including early meetings. This could explain why she needed to pick up Sara early from school.
- Sara: While it's possible for a student to have an early meeting, it's less likely, especially since she was being picked up from school.

Given this reasoning, it makes more sense that ""she"" refers to Mom. The early meeting is likely the reason why Mom had to bring Sara home early from school.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Mom.",0,0

2. The reason for Gorden's anger is given after ""because.""
3. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause explaining the reason.
4. The action associated with ""he"" is ""forgot to bring him chocolate.""

Given this information, it's more likely that ""he"" refers to ""his brother"" rather than Gorden. The sentence implies that Gorden is angry because someone else (his brother) forgot to bring him (Gorden) chocolate. It wouldn't make sense for Gorden to be angry at his brother because Gorden himself forgot to bring chocolate.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to ""his brother.""",1,1

2. The pronoun ""he"" is associated with being confused.
3. It's more likely that John asked Bill because John himself was confused, rather than John asking Bill because Bill was confused.
4. If Bill were confused, it would be more natural to say ""John asked Bill because Bill was confused"" instead of using a pronoun.

""John asked Bill because he knew the answer.""

In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" is more likely to refer to Bill for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure suggests that the reason John asked Bill is that someone ""knew the answer.""
2. It's more logical that John would ask Bill because Bill knew the answer, rather than John asking Bill because John himself knew the answer.
3. If John knew the answer, he wouldn't need to ask Bill.

1. John is the subject of the sentence and the one doing the rating.
2. Bill is the object being rated.
3. The pronoun ""he"" is described as ""the judge.""

Given this information, it's more logical that ""he"" refers to John rather than Bill. The sentence structure suggests that John is rating Bill because John (he) was the judge. It wouldn't make sense for Bill to be both the one being rated and the judge at the same time.

2. Bill is the object being rated.
3. The pronoun ""he"" is described as ""a contestant.""

Given this information, it's more likely that ""he"" refers to Bill for the following reasons:
- Being a contestant is typically the reason someone would be rated, rather than the reason someone would rate another person.

The pronoun ""he"" is more likely to refer to John for the following reasons:
1. John is the subject of the sentence and the one performing the action (calling).
2. The sentence structure suggests that the reason for the call (needing someone to talk to) is related to the person who initiated the call.
3. It's more logical that John called Bill because John needed someone to talk to, rather than John calling Bill because Bill needed someone to talk to.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to John.",0,0

269,John killed Bill because he was fighting for his life.,he,"0: John, 1: Bill, 2: Neither","To determine who ""he"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and logical flow of the statement.

1. The sentence states that ""John killed Bill.""
2. The reason given is ""because he was fighting for his life.""

Given this information, it's more likely that ""he"" refers to John rather than Bill. Here's why:

1. The sentence structure implies that the reason for John's action (killing Bill) is explained after ""because.""
2. If someone is ""fighting for his life,"" it usually means they are defending themselves against a threat.
3. Since John is the one who killed Bill, it makes more sense that John was the one fighting for his life, which led to him killing Bill in self-defense.

If ""he"" referred to Bill, the sentence would imply that John killed Bill because Bill was fighting for his life, which doesn't make logical sense in most contexts.

1. ""Billy beat Tommy at Scrabble"" - This tells us that Billy won the game against Tommy.
2. ""because that newbie had no skill"" - This part explains why Billy won.

The pronoun ""that newbie"" is used to refer to someone who is new or inexperienced at Scrabble. Since Billy won the game, it's unlikely that he would be referred to as the newbie with no skill. 

Therefore, ""that newbie"" most likely refers to Tommy, who lost the game due to lack of skill. This interpretation makes the most logical sense in the context of the sentence.",1,1
272,Billy beat Tommy at Scrabble because that newbie had all the luck.,that newbie,"0: Billy, 1: Tommy, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence:

1. Billy beat Tommy at Scrabble.
2. The pronoun ""that newbie"" is used to refer to one of them.
3. The sentence suggests that the person who won (Billy) did so because of luck, not skill.
4. The term ""newbie"" typically refers to someone who is new or inexperienced at something.
5. Since Billy won despite being lucky, it implies that he might be the less experienced player, hence the ""newbie.""

Given this reasoning, it's more likely that ""that newbie"" refers to Billy, as he's the one who won due to luck, suggesting he might be less experienced at the game.",0,0
273,Mary had a little lamb until she was stolen by Cindy.,she,"0: Mary, 1: a little lamb, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the sentence.
2. ""She"" is a feminine pronoun, so it must refer to a female person or animal.
3. We have two candidates: Mary and a little lamb.
4. Mary is a female name, so ""she"" could refer to Mary.
5. ""A little lamb"" is typically referred to as ""it"" unless its gender is specifically known, which is not indicated here.
6. The context of the sentence suggests that ""she"" is the subject who was stolen by Cindy.
7. It makes more logical sense for a person (Mary) to be stolen rather than a lamb in this context.

Given these points, it's most likely that ""she"" refers to Mary.",1,0
274,Mary had a little lamb until she had lamb chops for dinner.,she,"0: Mary, 1: a little lamb, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Mary is introduced as the subject of the sentence.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used later in the sentence.
3. The action associated with ""she"" is having ""lamb chops for dinner.""

It's logical to conclude that ""she"" refers to Mary because:
- Mary is the only human mentioned in the sentence.
- Eating lamb chops is an action typically associated with humans, not with lambs.
- The sentence structure suggests that Mary is the main subject throughout.

The little lamb is mentioned as something Mary had, but it's not a likely candidate for the pronoun ""she"" in this context.

2. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the clause ""because they were predators.""
3. Predators are animals that hunt and eat other animals.
4. Wolves are known predators, while deer are typically prey animals.
5. The sentence structure suggests that ""they"" refers to the subject of the main clause (the wolves) as the reason for the chase.

Based on this analysis, it's clear that ""they"" refers to ""The wolves"" because wolves are predators, and this characteristic explains why they were chasing the deer.",0,0
276,The wolves chased the deer because they were prey.,they,"0: The wolves, 1: the deer, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and logic of the sentence:

3. In nature, wolves are predators, and deer are prey.
4. The sentence states that ""they were prey,"" which logically refers to the deer, not the wolves.

277,The girls ate the apples because they were hungry.,they,"0: The girls, 1: the apples, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence logically:

1. The sentence states: ""The girls ate the apples because they were hungry.""
2. The pronoun ""they"" is used to explain the reason for the action (eating the apples).
3. Being hungry is a characteristic that can only apply to living beings, not to inanimate objects like apples.
4. ""The girls"" are the only living beings mentioned in the sentence.
5. It makes logical sense that the girls would eat the apples because the girls were hungry.
6. Apples cannot be hungry, so ""they"" cannot refer to the apples.

Therefore, the pronoun ""they"" must refer to ""The girls"" in this sentence.",0,0
278,The girls ate the apples because they were ripe.,they,"0: The girls, 1: the apples, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and logic of the sentence:

1. The sentence states: ""The girls ate the apples because they were ripe.""
2. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the clause explaining why the action (eating) occurred.
3. Logically, ripeness is a quality that applies to fruit, not to people.
4. Apples can be ripe, while girls cannot be described as ""ripe"" in this context.
5. The ripeness is the reason for eating the apples, which makes sense.

Therefore, ""they"" must refer to ""the apples"" because it's logical that the apples were ripe, and this explains why the girls ate them.",1,1
279,The minister befriended King George so he would not get beheaded.,he,"0: The minister, 1: King George, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence presents two characters: the minister and King George.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""so he would not get beheaded.""
3. The action of befriending is performed by the minister towards King George.
4. The purpose of this action is to avoid getting beheaded.

Given this analysis, it's more logical that the minister is the one trying to avoid being beheaded by befriending King George. Kings typically have the power to order executions, not the other way around. Therefore, ""he"" most likely refers to the minister.",0,0
280,The minister befriended King George so he could have some friends.,he,"0: The minister, 1: King George, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions two male individuals: the minister and King George.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""so he could have some friends.""
3. The action of befriending is initiated by the minister, as indicated by ""The minister befriended King George.""
4. The purpose of this action is explained in the second part of the sentence, suggesting that the subject of the first part (the minister) is the one who wants to have friends.
5. It would be illogical for King George to be the one wanting friends in this context, as he is the object of the befriending action.

Based on this analysis, it is most likely that ""he"" refers to the minister, as he is the one who initiated the action of befriending with the purpose of having friends.",1,0
281,Mary likes Joe because she has a cool name.,she,"0: Mary, 1: Joe, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" is used to refer to one of the two people mentioned: Mary or Joe. To determine which one it refers to, we need to consider the context and logic of the sentence.

The sentence states ""Mary likes Joe because she has a cool name."" Here, the pronoun ""she"" is more likely to refer to Mary for the following reasons:

1. Gender agreement: ""She"" is a feminine pronoun, which matches Mary (typically a female name) rather than Joe (typically a male name).

2. Logical consistency: It would be more logical for Mary to like Joe because of Mary's own name rather than Joe's name. If it were referring to Joe's name, the sentence would likely be phrased differently, such as ""Mary likes Joe because he has a cool name.""

3. Grammatical structure: In English, pronouns typically refer to the most recently mentioned noun of the same gender, which in this case is Mary.

Therefore, based on these considerations, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Mary.",1,"0

1. The sentence states ""Mary likes Joe because she likes females.""
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used to refer to someone who likes females.
3. Given the context, it's more logical that ""she"" refers to Mary, not Joe.
4. Mary is typically a female name, while Joe is typically a male name.

283,The bat hit the ball because it flew in the way of the trajectory.,it,"0: The bat, 1: the ball, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""it"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and logic of the sentence.

The sentence states that ""The bat hit the ball because it flew in the way of the trajectory."" Let's consider each candidate:

1. The bat: Bats are typically held by players and don't fly on their own during a game. It's unlikely that the bat would fly into the trajectory of itself hitting the ball.

2. The ball: In baseball or similar sports, the ball is the object that travels through the air after being hit. It makes logical sense that the ball would fly in the way of a trajectory.

3. Neither: This option doesn't seem applicable here, as the pronoun ""it"" clearly refers to one of the two mentioned objects in the sentence.

Given this analysis, it's most logical that ""it"" refers to ""the ball."" The sentence is explaining that the bat hit the ball because the ball flew into the path (trajectory) where the bat was swinging.",0,1
284,The bat hit the ball because it flew straight at the poor animal.,it,"0: The bat, 1: the ball, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. ""The bat hit the ball"" - This sets up the initial action.
2. ""because it flew straight"" - Here, ""it"" refers to something that flew.
3. ""at the poor animal"" - This suggests that the ""it"" is moving towards an animal.

Given this information, we can deduce:
- The bat is likely an inanimate object (a baseball bat) rather than the animal, as it's referred to as hitting the ball.
- The ball is the object that would typically fly after being hit.
- The phrase ""poor animal"" at the end suggests that the bat (the animal) was hit by the flying object.

Therefore, ""it"" in this context most likely refers to the ball, as it's the object that would fly after being hit and could potentially hit an animal (the bat).",1,1
285,The knife sliced through the flesh because it was sharp.,it,"0: The knife, 1: the flesh, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""it"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence logically:

1. The sentence states that ""The knife sliced through the flesh because it was sharp.""
2. The pronoun ""it"" is used to describe something that is sharp.
3. In this context, sharpness is a quality typically associated with a knife, not with flesh.
4. The sentence structure implies that the sharpness is the reason for the knife's ability to slice through the flesh.

Therefore, ""it"" most likely refers to ""The knife"" because knives are known for their sharpness, and this quality enables them to cut through flesh.",0,0
286,The knife sliced through the flesh because it was tender.,it,"0: The knife, 1: the flesh, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""it"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence logically:

1. ""The knife sliced through the flesh because it was tender.""

The pronoun ""it"" is used in the clause ""because it was tender."" We need to consider which of the candidates makes sense as being described as ""tender.""

- The knife: Knives are not typically described as tender. They are usually hard and sharp.
- The flesh: Flesh, especially in the context of being cut, is often described as tender.

The adjective ""tender"" is much more likely to describe flesh than a knife. The sentence is explaining why the knife was able to slice through the flesh easily - because the flesh was tender.

Therefore, the pronoun ""it"" most likely refers to ""the flesh.""",1,1

1. The sentence starts with ""The boy lied to his father about the crime.""
2. The pronoun ""he"" appears in the second part of the sentence: ""but he still felt uneasy and was slowly overcome with guilt.""

The pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to ""The boy"" for the following reasons:
1. The boy is the subject of the first part of the sentence, making him the primary focus.
2. The feeling of uneasiness and guilt described in the second part of the sentence logically follows from the action of lying mentioned in the first part.
3. It makes more sense for the person who lied (the boy) to feel guilty about it, rather than the person who was lied to (the father).

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to ""The boy"" (candidate 0).",0,0

The pronoun ""he"" is more likely to refer to the boy for the following reasons:
1. The boy is the subject of the first part of the sentence, making him the primary focus.
2. The feeling of uneasiness and curiosity described after ""but"" is more likely to be experienced by someone who has committed a wrongdoing (lying about a crime) rather than the person who was lied to.
3. It's more logical for the boy to feel uneasy and curious after lying about a crime, as he might be worried about the consequences or wonder if his father believes him.

1. ""The apple wine"" is the subject of the sentence.
2. ""my mouth"" is part of a prepositional phrase describing where the apple wine entered.
3. The pronoun ""it"" is used in the clause ""because it tastes good.""

Logically, ""it"" refers to something that can taste good. Between the two candidates, only ""The apple wine"" can have a taste. ""My mouth"" doesn't have its own taste; rather, it's the organ that perceives taste.

Therefore, ""it"" most likely refers to ""The apple wine.""",0,0
290,The apple wine entered my mouth because it was not full.,it,"0: The apple wine, 1: my mouth, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence carefully:

""The apple wine entered my mouth because it was not full.""

The pronoun ""it"" in this sentence is referring to ""my mouth"" for the following reasons:

1. Logical context: It makes more sense that the mouth was not full, allowing the wine to enter, rather than the wine not being full.

2. Grammatical structure: The pronoun ""it"" is more likely to refer to the closest preceding noun, which in this case is ""mouth.""

3. Semantic meaning: The sentence is explaining why the wine could enter the mouth. It's because the mouth had space (was not full), not because the wine had some property of not being full.

Therefore, the pronoun ""it"" is referring to ""my mouth"" (candidate 1) in this context.",1,1

The pronoun ""he"" is more likely to refer to ""The boy"" for the following reasons:
1. ""The boy"" is the subject of the main clause and the primary actor in the sentence.
2. The fact that ""he was going to be free all day"" explains why the boy was able to help his friend move. It makes more sense that the boy had free time, which allowed him to help his friend, rather than the friend having free time and somehow causing the boy to help him.
3. If ""he"" referred to the friend, the sentence would imply that the boy helped his friend move because the friend was free all day, which is less logical.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to ""The boy.""",0,0

1. The sentence states that ""The boy helped his friend move.""
2. The reason given is ""because he was going to be busy all day.""

Logically, it makes more sense that the friend would be the one who was going to be busy all day, which is why the boy helped him move. If the boy was going to be busy all day, it wouldn't explain why he was helping his friend move.

293,The boy secretly watched his friend because he wanted the secret information.,he,"0: The boy, 1: his friend, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence presents two male subjects: ""The boy"" and ""his friend"".
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the latter part of the sentence, introducing a reason for the action.
3. The action ""secretly watched"" is performed by ""The boy"" on ""his friend"".
4. The reason given is ""wanted the secret information"", which logically aligns with the person doing the watching.

Given this analysis, it makes more sense that ""he"" refers to ""The boy"" because:
- The boy is the subject performing the main action (watching).
- The desire for secret information explains why the boy was secretly watching his friend.
- It would be less logical for ""he"" to refer to ""his friend"" in this context, as the friend is the object being watched and is not described as performing any action.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to ""The boy"".",0,0
294,The boy secretly watched his friend because he had the secret information.,he,"0: The boy, 1: his friend, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

The pronoun ""he"" is more likely to refer to ""The boy"" for the following reasons:
1. ""The boy"" is the main subject of the sentence and is in a more prominent position.
2. The action of secretly watching suggests that ""The boy"" is the one with the secret information, which is the reason for his watching.
3. If ""he"" referred to ""his friend,"" it would imply that the friend had secret information about himself, which doesn't make as much sense in this context.

1. The sentence has two main parts separated by ""but"":
   - ""The bug was flying towards the light""
   - ""it was exterminated prematurely""

2. The pronoun ""it"" is used in the second part of the sentence.

3. Logically, something that can be ""exterminated"" is more likely to be a living organism, like a bug, rather than an inanimate object like a light.

4. The sentence is describing the bug's action (flying towards the light) and then what happened to the bug (it was exterminated).

5. It wouldn't make sense for ""it"" to refer to ""the light"" in this context, as lights are not typically ""exterminated.""

Given these points, we can conclude that ""it"" most likely refers to ""The bug"" in this sentence.",0,0

1. The sentence describes two entities: the bug and the light.
2. The pronoun ""it"" is used in the clause ""but it was extinguished prematurely.""
3. The verb ""extinguished"" is typically associated with light sources, not insects.
4. It makes more logical sense for a light to be extinguished than for a bug to be extinguished.

1. The sentence starts with ""The man offered the boy candy"".
2. This is followed by ""but he had no candy"".

The use of ""but"" indicates a contrast or contradiction to the first part of the sentence. If the man was offering candy, it would be contradictory and illogical for him to not have any candy. Therefore, ""he"" most likely refers to the man.

The sentence is essentially saying: The man offered the boy candy, but (contrary to what you might expect from someone offering candy) the man had no candy.

1. Paul is the subject of the main clause and the one performing the action (screaming).
2. The sentence structure suggests that the reason for Paul's action (screaming) is explained in the second part of the sentence (being angry).
3. It's more logical that Paul was angry, which caused him to scream at Jack, rather than Jack being angry and Paul screaming at him as a result.

1. Paul screamed at Jack
2. The reason for screaming: ""since he was ignoring him""

The pronoun ""he"" in this context refers to the person who was ignoring someone. Given the structure of the sentence, it makes more sense that Jack was ignoring Paul, which prompted Paul to scream at Jack.

If we replace ""he"" with each candidate:

2. Both ""The baby cow"" and ""the farmer"" could potentially be male.
3. The sentence states that ""he wanted milk.""
4. It's more logical for a baby cow to want milk than for a farmer to want milk in this context.
5. Baby cows naturally seek milk from their mothers or for feeding.
6. Farmers typically provide milk rather than wanting it for themselves in this context.

1. The pronoun ""he"" is masculine, which typically refers to male subjects.
2. ""The baby cow"" is likely not the referent because:
   a) Baby cows are usually referred to as ""it"" unless their gender is specifically known.
   b) Cows (female cattle) produce milk, not male cattle.
3. ""The farmer"" is a more likely referent because:
   a) Farmers are often referred to as ""he"" (though this can be gender-stereotyping).
   b) The sentence implies that ""he had milk,"" which makes more sense for a farmer (who would have milk from the cows) than for a baby cow.

1. ""The city council granted a permit to the construction workers because they were elected to encourage business.""

The key points to consider are:
- The pronoun ""they"" is associated with the action of being ""elected to encourage business.""
- City councils are typically elected bodies, while construction workers are not.
- The purpose of encouraging business aligns more with the responsibilities of a city council than with construction workers.

Given these factors, it's clear that ""they"" refers to ""The city council.""

3. The reason given for the Lions' victory is that ""they had more desire to win.""

Based on this analysis, it's logical to conclude that ""they"" refers to the team that won the game and had more desire to win, which is the Detroit Lions. The pronoun is used to explain why the Lions were victorious, not to describe the Cowboys.",0,0
314,The Detroit Lions beat the Dallas Cowboys because they were unprepared.,they,"0: The Detroit Lions, 1: the Dallas Cowboys, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence states that ""The Detroit Lions beat the Dallas Cowboys because they were unprepared.""
2. The pronoun ""they"" is used to explain the reason for the outcome of the game.
3. Logically, the team that lost (Dallas Cowboys) would be the one that was unprepared, not the team that won (Detroit Lions).
4. Therefore, ""they"" most likely refers to the Dallas Cowboys, as their lack of preparation is given as the reason for their loss.

Based on this reasoning, the pronoun ""they"" refers to the Dallas Cowboys.",1,1
315,James Cameron is more successful than Michael Bay because his movies sell more worldwide.,his,"0: James Cameron, 1: Michael Bay, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""his"" refers to James Cameron. The context of the sentence is comparing James Cameron's success to Michael Bay's, stating that Cameron is more successful because ""his movies sell more worldwide.""

316,James Cameron is more successful than Michael Bay because his movies do not create as much hype.,his,"0: James Cameron, 1: Michael Bay, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""his"" refers to James Cameron. The sentence is comparing James Cameron to Michael Bay, stating that Cameron is more successful. The latter part of the sentence provides a reason for this comparison, saying ""his movies do not create as much hype."" This implies that James Cameron's movies are being referred to, as the sentence is explaining why he is more successful than Michael Bay. Therefore, ""his"" in this context refers to James Cameron.",1,0
317,Audrey Hepburn made more movies than Katherine Hepburn because she was pretty and talented.,she,"0: Audrey Hepburn, 1: Katherine Hepburn, 2: Neither","The pronoun ""she"" in this sentence most likely refers to Audrey Hepburn for the following reasons:

1. Sentence structure: The sentence begins with Audrey Hepburn as the subject, making her the primary focus of the statement.

2. Comparison: The sentence compares Audrey Hepburn to Katherine Hepburn, with Audrey being presented as the one who made more movies.

3. Attributions: The qualities ""pretty and talented"" are given as reasons for making more movies. While both actresses were talented, Audrey Hepburn was particularly known for her beauty and style, which aligns more closely with the description.

4. Proximity: Audrey Hepburn is mentioned first in the sentence, making her the most recent subject before the pronoun ""she"" is used.

Given these factors, it is most logical to conclude that ""she"" refers to Audrey Hepburn in this context.",0,0
318,Audrey Hepburn made more movies than Katherine Hepburn because she was not as good at acting.,she,"0: Audrey Hepburn, 1: Katherine Hepburn, 2: Neither","The pronoun ""she"" in this sentence is ambiguous and could potentially refer to either Audrey Hepburn or Katherine Hepburn. However, given the context of the sentence, it is more likely that ""she"" refers to Katherine Hepburn. The sentence implies that one of the Hepburns made more movies than the other because of a difference in acting ability. Since Audrey Hepburn is mentioned as making more movies, the logical conclusion is that Katherine Hepburn is the one who ""was not as good at acting."" Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Katherine Hepburn.",1,1
319,The Penguins scored two goals against the Flyers in two minutes because they were not concentrating.,they,"0: The Penguins, 1: the Flyers, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence mentions two teams: the Penguins and the Flyers.
2. The Penguins are described as scoring two goals against the Flyers.
3. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the clause ""because they were not concentrating.""
4. Logically, the team that was not concentrating would be the one that allowed goals to be scored against them.
5. In this case, it was the Flyers who allowed the Penguins to score two goals.

Therefore, ""they"" most likely refers to the Flyers, as they were the ones who were not concentrating, which resulted in the Penguins scoring two goals against them.",1,1
320,The Penguins scored two goals against the Flyers in two minutes because they are more skilled.,they,"0: The Penguins, 1: the Flyers, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" refers to ""The Penguins"" for the following reasons:

1. The Penguins are the subject of the sentence and the main focus of the action (scoring two goals).
2. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the context of explaining why the Penguins were able to score two goals quickly.
3. The phrase ""because they are more skilled"" implies that the subject (The Penguins) possesses superior skills, which allowed them to score against the Flyers.

It wouldn't make sense for ""they"" to refer to the Flyers in this context, as the Flyers are not described as performing any action that would require skill. The sentence is clearly praising the Penguins' abilities.",0,0
321,Taylor Swift is higher in record sales over Beyonce because more people can relate to her music.,her,"0: Taylor Swift, 1: Beyonce, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""her"" is referring to Taylor Swift. The context of the sentence is comparing Taylor Swift's record sales to Beyonce's, and the reason given for Taylor Swift's higher sales is that ""more people can relate to her music."" Since Taylor Swift is the subject of the comparison and the one being described as having more relatable music, it's clear that ""her"" is referring to Taylor Swift's music, not Beyonce's.",0,0
322,Taylor Swift is higher in record sales over Beyonce because people are not passionate about her music.,her,"0: Taylor Swift, 1: Beyonce, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""her"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence compares Taylor Swift and Beyonce in terms of record sales.
2. The pronoun ""her"" is used at the end of the sentence in the phrase ""her music.""
3. The sentence structure suggests that ""her music"" refers to the person who is not selling as many records.
4. The sentence states that Taylor Swift has higher record sales than Beyonce.
5. Therefore, ""her music"" must be referring to Beyonce, as the sentence implies that people are not passionate about Beyonce's music, which explains why Taylor Swift has higher record sales.

Based on this analysis, the pronoun ""her"" refers to Beyonce.",1,1
323,Fox News is more popular in ratings than CNN since they are more interesting.,they,"0: Fox News, 1: CNN, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" refers to Fox News. The sentence structure suggests that ""they"" is the subject that is ""more interesting,"" which is given as the reason for Fox News being more popular in ratings than CNN. The pronoun ""they"" is used to avoid repeating ""Fox News"" in the second part of the sentence. Therefore, ""they"" logically refers to Fox News, not CNN.",0,0
324,Fox News is more popular in ratings than CNN since they are boring.,they,"0: Fox News, 1: CNN, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and structure of the sentence:

1. The sentence compares Fox News and CNN in terms of popularity.
2. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the latter part of the sentence to describe a characteristic.
3. The characteristic described is ""boring,"" which is given as a reason for being less popular.
4. Logically, the less popular network would be described as ""boring"" in this context.
5. The sentence states that Fox News is more popular than CNN.

Therefore, ""they"" most likely refers to CNN, as CNN is implied to be less popular and thus described as ""boring"" in comparison to Fox News.",1,1
325,The Autobots try to stop the Decepticons since they want the world to live in peace.,they,"0: The Autobots, 1: the Decepticons, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and meaning of the sentence:

1. The sentence presents two groups: the Autobots and the Decepticons.
2. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the clause ""they want the world to live in peace.""
3. The sentence structure suggests that the Autobots are trying to stop the Decepticons for a reason.
4. The reason given is wanting the world to live in peace.
5. Logically, it makes more sense that the Autobots, who are trying to stop the Decepticons, are the ones who want peace.
6. The Decepticons, being the group that needs to be stopped, are unlikely to be the ones wanting peace.

Therefore, based on the context and logical interpretation, ""they"" most likely refers to the Autobots.",0,0

The sentence structure indicates that the Autobots are trying to stop the Decepticons because of a specific reason, which is introduced by ""since.""

327,Californians are better than New Yorkers because they have Hollywood.,they,"0: Californians, 1: New Yorkers, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" refers to Californians. The sentence is comparing Californians to New Yorkers and stating that Californians are better because ""they have Hollywood."" Since Hollywood is located in California and is associated with Californians, it's clear that ""they"" is referring to Californians and not New Yorkers.",0,0
328,Californians are better than New Yorkers because they do not have Hollywood lots to produce movies.,they,"0: Californians, 1: New Yorkers, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence carefully:

""Californians are better than New Yorkers because they do not have Hollywood lots to produce movies.""

The pronoun ""they"" in this sentence is referring to the subject that does NOT have Hollywood lots. Given that Hollywood is located in California, it would be illogical for ""they"" to refer to Californians. 

The sentence is structured to suggest that Californians are better than New Yorkers for a specific reason. That reason is that ""they"" (the subject being referred to) do not have Hollywood lots. This implies that the ""they"" must be referring to New Yorkers.

The sentence is making a comparison, stating that Californians are better because New Yorkers lack something that Californians have (Hollywood lots). Therefore, ""they"" in this context refers to New Yorkers.",1,1
329,The Mongolians attacked the Chinese because they are always eager for war.,they,"0: The Mongolians, 1: the Chinese, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and meaning of the sentence:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""they"" refers to the subject of the clause following ""because"".
2. The pronoun ""they"" is associated with the characteristic ""always eager for war"".
3. In historical context, the Mongolians were known for their military conquests and expansionist policies.
4. The sentence implies that the reason for the Mongolians attacking the Chinese is the subject's eagerness for war.

Given these points, it's more logical and historically accurate to associate ""always eager for war"" with the Mongolians rather than the Chinese in this context. The pronoun ""they"" is more likely referring to the Mongolians, who are the subject of the main clause and the ones performing the action of attacking.",0,0
330,The Mongolians attacked the Chinese because they are pacifists.,they,"0: The Mongolians, 1: the Chinese, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun 'they' is more likely to refer to 'the Chinese' rather than 'The Mongolians'. The sentence structure suggests that the reason for the Mongolians' attack is that the Chinese are pacifists. It wouldn't make logical sense for the Mongolians to attack because they themselves (the Mongolians) are pacifists. Pacifists are generally known for avoiding conflict, not initiating attacks. Therefore, 'they' in this context refers to 'the Chinese'.",1,1
331,"Jupiter is bigger than the Earth, but it is lighter due to being mostly gas.",it,"0: Jupiter, 1: the Earth, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""it"" refers to Jupiter. The sentence structure indicates that we're comparing Jupiter to Earth, and then providing additional information about Jupiter. The clause ""but it is lighter"" is continuing to describe Jupiter, contrasting its size with its weight. This makes sense in the context of Jupiter being a gas giant - it's larger than Earth but less dense due to its composition. Therefore, ""it"" in this sentence is referring to Jupiter.",0,0
332,"Jupiter is bigger than the Earth, but it is heavier due to being solid.",it,"0: Jupiter, 1: the Earth, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. The pronoun ""it"" is used in the second part of the sentence: ""but it is heavier due to being solid.""

2. The sentence compares Jupiter and Earth, mentioning two characteristics: size and weight.

3. The first part of the sentence states that ""Jupiter is bigger than the Earth.""

4. The second part, using ""it,"" contradicts the expectation set by the first part. It says that despite being bigger, ""it is heavier due to being solid.""

5. Logically, the pronoun ""it"" must refer to the subject of the first part of the sentence, which is Jupiter.

6. Additionally, the statement about being ""solid"" is incorrect for Jupiter (which is a gas giant), but this factual error doesn't change the grammatical reference of the pronoun.

Therefore, based on the grammatical structure and logic of the sentence, the pronoun ""it"" refers to Jupiter.",1,0
333,Brick is better than clay for building houses because they are much stronger building materials.,they,"0: Brick, 1: clay, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" is used to refer to both brick and clay collectively, not just one of them. The sentence is comparing brick and clay as building materials, stating that brick is better because ""they"" (referring to bricks) are much stronger building materials. However, grammatically, ""they"" could also be interpreted as referring to both brick and clay as building materials in general.

Given the context and the way the sentence is structured, it's more likely that ""they"" is meant to refer to bricks specifically, as the sentence is emphasizing the superiority of brick over clay. But since the pronoun ""they"" is plural and could grammatically refer to both brick and clay, we cannot definitively say it refers to only one of the candidates.

Therefore, the most appropriate answer is that ""they"" refers to neither brick nor clay exclusively, but rather to both or to building materials in general.",0,2
334,Brick is better than clay for building houses because they become weak from water.,they,"0: Brick, 1: clay, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" refers to ""clay"" rather than ""brick"". The context suggests that something becomes weak from water, and this is more likely to be true for clay than for brick. Brick is generally known to be more water-resistant than clay, which is why the sentence states that brick is better than clay for building houses. Therefore, ""they"" in this context is referring to clay, which becomes weak when exposed to water.",1,1
335,"The Dallas Cowboys are more successful as a franchise than the Saints because they are considered ""America's Team"".",they,"0: The Dallas Cowboys, 1: the Saints, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" refers to the Dallas Cowboys. The reasoning is as follows:

1. The sentence is comparing the Dallas Cowboys to the Saints.
2. The main clause states that the Dallas Cowboys are more successful than the Saints.
3. The second part of the sentence provides a reason for this success, introduced by ""because"".
4. The pronoun ""they"" is used in this explanatory clause.
5. Logically, the explanation for why the Cowboys are more successful would refer to the Cowboys, not the Saints.
6. The phrase ""America's Team"" is a well-known nickname for the Dallas Cowboys, not the Saints.

Therefore, ""they"" in this context clearly refers to the Dallas Cowboys.",0,0
336,The Dallas Cowboys are more successful as a franchise than the Saints because they do not have the same amount of market value.,they,"0: The Dallas Cowboys, 1: the Saints, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" refers to ""the Saints"" for the following reasons:

1. The sentence is comparing the Dallas Cowboys to the Saints.
2. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the latter part of the sentence to provide additional information about one of the teams.
3. Logically, it makes more sense for ""they"" to refer to the Saints because the sentence is explaining why the Cowboys are more successful than the Saints.
4. The phrase ""do not have the same amount of market value"" is likely referring to the Saints having less market value than the Cowboys, which supports the claim that the Cowboys are more successful.

Therefore, ""they"" is most likely referring to ""the Saints"" in this context.",1,1
337,The US government declared war on Iraq because they were responding to their attack on US soil.,they,"0: The US government, 1: Iraq, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" refers to ""The US government"" for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure indicates that ""they"" is the subject performing the action of ""responding.""
2. Logically, it makes more sense that the US government would be responding to an attack on US soil, rather than Iraq responding to their own attack.
3. The pronoun ""they"" is used to avoid repeating ""The US government"" in the same sentence.
4. The use of ""their"" later in the sentence likely refers to Iraq's attack, further supporting that ""they"" refers to the US government.

Therefore, the pronoun ""they"" most likely refers to ""The US government"" in this context.",0,0
338,The US government declared war on Iraq because they attacked on US soil.,they,"0: The US government, 1: Iraq, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" refers to Iraq. The context suggests that the US government declared war on Iraq as a result of an attack. Since the US government is the subject performing the action of declaring war, it wouldn't make sense for ""they"" to refer to the US government. Instead, ""they"" is used to refer to Iraq, implying that Iraq was responsible for attacking on US soil, which led to the US government's declaration of war.",1,1
339,The Home Owners Association denied the request by the Pittsburg family for a new shed since they failed to pay the annual fee.,they,"0: The Home Owners Association, 1: the Pittsburg family, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence is about a request denial by the Home Owners Association.
2. The request was made by the Pittsburg family.
3. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the context of failing to pay the annual fee.

Given this information, it's more logical that ""they"" refers to the Pittsburg family for the following reasons:
- It's more likely that the family, as homeowners, would be responsible for paying an annual fee to the Home Owners Association.
- The sentence structure suggests that the reason for denial (failing to pay the fee) is related to the party making the request (the Pittsburg family).
- It would be unusual for the Home Owners Association to deny a request because they themselves failed to pay a fee.

Therefore, the pronoun ""they"" most likely refers to the Pittsburg family.",1,1

1. The sentence is about the Home Owners Association denying a request made by the Pittsburg family.
2. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the clause ""they felt it would not be good for the community.""
3. The action of feeling something would not be good for the community is more likely to be associated with the decision-making body, which in this case is the Home Owners Association.
4. It wouldn't make sense for the Pittsburg family to feel that their own request for a shed would not be good for the community.

Based on this analysis, it's clear that ""they"" refers to the Home Owners Association, as they are the ones making the decision and likely to have concerns about the community's well-being.",0,0
341,Fleece feels better than cotton since they are much softer.,they,"0: Fleece, 1: cotton, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" refers to ""Fleece"" rather than ""cotton"". The sentence is comparing fleece to cotton, stating that fleece feels better because ""they"" (referring to fleece) are much softer. The use of ""they"" in this context is a bit unusual since ""fleece"" is typically treated as a singular noun, but the intent seems to be to refer to fleece items or materials in general.",0,0
342,Fleece feels better than cotton since they are of worse quality.,they,"0: Fleece, 1: cotton, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" is used ambiguously and doesn't clearly refer to either fleece or cotton. The statement ""they are of worse quality"" contradicts the first part of the sentence, which suggests that fleece feels better than cotton. This contradiction makes it unclear which material ""they"" is referring to. 

Given the context, it's more likely that the speaker intended to say that cotton is of worse quality (since fleece feels better), but the sentence is poorly constructed and doesn't convey this clearly. Due to this ambiguity and the contradictory nature of the statement, we cannot confidently assign the pronoun ""they"" to either fleece or cotton.",1,2
343,"The Police feared allowing the protesters to organize, so they denied their ability to gather.",they,"0: The Police, 1: the protesters, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and structure of the sentence:

1. The sentence starts with ""The Police"" as the subject.
2. The verb ""feared"" is associated with the Police.
3. The pronoun ""they"" appears later in the sentence and is performing an action (denying).
4. It's logical that the group with the power to deny the ability to gather would be the Police, not the protesters.

344,"The Police feared allowing the protesters to organize, but they decided to organize anyway.",they,"0: The Police, 1: the protesters, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and logic of the sentence:

1. The sentence presents two groups: The Police and the protesters.
2. The first part of the sentence states that ""The Police feared allowing the protesters to organize.""
3. The second part, connected by ""but,"" indicates a contrasting action: ""they decided to organize anyway.""
4. Logically, the group that ""decided to organize anyway"" would be the protesters, not the Police.
5. The Police were trying to prevent the organization, so it wouldn't make sense for them to be the ones deciding to organize.
6. The use of ""anyway"" further supports that the protesters went against the wishes of the Police.

1. The sentence discusses two entities: the government and oil companies.
2. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the clause ""they are trying to protect the environment.""
3. The action of revoking the ability for oil companies to drill is attributed to the government.
4. The reason for this action is to protect the environment.
5. It is more logical and consistent that the entity trying to protect the environment is the same one that revoked the drilling rights.

Given this analysis, it makes more sense that ""they"" refers to the government rather than the oil companies. The government is the entity taking action to protect the environment by revoking drilling rights from oil companies.",0,0
346,The government revoked the ability for oil companies to drill in the United States since they are trying to drill for more oil reserves.,they,"0: The government, 1: oil companies, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and logic of the sentence:

1. The sentence starts with ""The government"" taking an action against oil companies.
2. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the latter part of the sentence, referring to a group that is ""trying to drill for more oil reserves.""
3. It's logical that oil companies would be the ones trying to drill for more oil reserves, not the government.
4. The government's action (revoking drilling ability) is in response to the group's attempt to drill more, which further supports that ""they"" refers to oil companies.

1. The sentence describes an action taken by the Military Police (throwing someone in the brig) and provides a reason for this action.

2. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the clause ""since they were causing a disturbance in the neighboring town."" This clause explains the reason for the action.

3. It's more logical that the army recruits were causing the disturbance, not the Military Police. The Military Police are typically responsible for maintaining order, not causing disturbances.

4. The structure of the sentence suggests that ""they"" refers to the object of the main clause (the army recruits) rather than the subject (the Military Police).

1. Subject agreement: ""The football players"" is the main subject of the first clause, and ""they"" is the subject of the second clause. It's common for pronouns to refer back to the main subject of a sentence.

2. Logical consistency: The sentence states that the football players went on strike, and then mentions that ""they will play again when their demands are met."" It makes sense that the ones who went on strike are the same ones who will play again once their demands are met.

3. Context: The strike is described as being ""against the NFL organization,"" which puts the NFL in an opposing position to the football players. It wouldn't make sense for ""they"" to refer to the NFL organization in this context.

2. Logical flow: The sentence describes the football players going on strike, and then mentions considering demands to end the strike. It makes more sense for the players to consider demands to end their own strike, rather than the NFL organization considering demands.

3. Active role: The football players are portrayed as the active party in the sentence (they went on strike), so it's more likely that they would be the ones considering demands to end it.

4. Contextual understanding: In labor disputes, it's typically the striking party (in this case, the players) who consider demands to end their strike, not the organization they're striking against.

The context of the sentence is comparing Disney World to Six Flags, and the pronoun is used in relation to having ""a much larger budget due to their merchandising."" This characteristic is more likely to be associated with Disney World, which is known for its extensive merchandising and larger scale operations compared to Six Flags.",0,0
356,Disney World offers a much wider array of rides than Six Flags since they are more limited on budget due to not having other sources of revenue.,they,"0: Disney World, 1: Six Flags, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" refers to Six Flags. The context of the sentence indicates that ""they"" are more limited on budget and don't have other sources of revenue. This description contrasts with Disney World, which is described as offering a wider array of rides. Therefore, ""they"" must be referring to Six Flags, as Disney World is known for its diverse attractions and multiple revenue streams.",1,1
357,South Korea does not like North Korea because they are constantly threatening their peace.,they,"0: South Korea, 1: North Korea, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence is about the relationship between South Korea and North Korea.
2. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the clause ""they are constantly threatening their peace.""
3. The action of ""threatening peace"" is more likely to be associated with North Korea, as it is generally known for its aggressive stance towards South Korea.
4. The pronoun ""their"" in ""their peace"" likely refers to South Korea's peace, which is being threatened.

Based on this analysis, it is clear that ""they"" refers to North Korea, as North Korea is the one described as threatening peace.",1,1
358,South Korea does not like North Korea because they are always forced to defend their peace.,they,"0: South Korea, 1: North Korea, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and meaning of the sentence:

1. The sentence is about the relationship between South Korea and North Korea.
2. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the clause ""they are always forced to defend their peace.""
3. The subject of the sentence is South Korea, and the statement is from South Korea's perspective.
4. It's logical that South Korea would be the one forced to defend their peace against North Korea's actions.
5. North Korea is unlikely to be described as defending peace in this context.

Based on this analysis, it's clear that ""they"" refers to South Korea. South Korea is the one being described as always forced to defend their peace, which aligns with the overall meaning of the sentence.",0,0
359,The prosecutor viciously attacked the defendants since they are trying to convict them of the crime.,they,"0: The prosecutor, 1: the defendants, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""they"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. ""The prosecutor viciously attacked the defendants"" - This establishes the two parties involved: the prosecutor and the defendants.

2. ""since they are trying to convict them of the crime"" - This part provides the key information for resolving the pronoun reference.

The pronoun ""they"" is used in relation to the action of ""trying to convict."" In a legal context, it is the prosecutor's role to try to convict defendants of crimes, not the other way around. The defendants would not be trying to convict themselves.

Therefore, ""they"" must refer to the prosecutor. The use of ""them"" later in the sentence further confirms this, as it clearly refers to the defendants (the prosecutor is trying to convict them).",0,0
360,The prosecutor viciously attacked the defendants since they are trying to convict their client of a crime.,they,"0: The prosecutor, 1: the defendants, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence carefully:

1. ""The prosecutor viciously attacked the defendants"" - This is the main action of the sentence.
2. ""since they are trying to convict their client of a crime"" - This is the reason given for the prosecutor's action.

The pronoun ""they"" in this context refers to the subject who is trying to convict someone. In a legal setting, it's the prosecutor's job to try to convict defendants, not the other way around. The defendants wouldn't be trying to convict their own client.

Therefore, ""they"" must refer to ""The prosecutor"". The sentence is explaining that the prosecutor attacked the defendants because the prosecutor (they) is trying to convict the prosecutor's client (which in this context means the state or the people they represent) of a crime.",1,0
361,The ruling class treats the citizens poorly because they are superior.,they,"0: The ruling class, 1: the citizens, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence presents two groups: ""The ruling class"" and ""the citizens.""
2. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the clause ""because they are superior.""
3. Logically, the group that would consider themselves superior would be the ruling class, not the citizens.
4. The sentence implies that the ruling class's poor treatment of citizens stems from their belief in their own superiority.

Given this analysis, it's most likely that ""they"" refers to ""The ruling class."" The sentence is explaining the reasoning behind the ruling class's actions, attributing it to their sense of superiority.",0,0
362,The ruling class treats the citizens poorly because they are inferior.,they,"0: The ruling class, 1: the citizens, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence has two groups: ""The ruling class"" and ""the citizens"".
2. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the clause ""because they are inferior"".
3. Logically, it wouldn't make sense for the ruling class to treat citizens poorly because the ruling class themselves are inferior.
4. It's more likely that the ruling class is treating the citizens poorly because they (the ruling class) view the citizens as inferior.
5. The pronoun ""they"" is being used to refer to the citizens, who are being described as inferior from the perspective of the ruling class.

Therefore, the pronoun ""they"" most likely refers to ""the citizens"".",1,1
363,"Bill Gates is similar to Steve Jobs, but he is the previous CEO of Microsoft.",he,"0: Bill Gates, 1: Steve Jobs, 2: Neither","The pronoun ""he"" in this sentence refers to Bill Gates for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" is being used to provide additional information about one of the two people mentioned.

2. The information provided after ""he"" states that this person is ""the previous CEO of Microsoft."" This is a well-known fact about Bill Gates, not Steve Jobs.

3. The use of ""but"" before ""he"" indicates a contrast or additional information about the first person mentioned in the sentence, which is Bill Gates.

4. Steve Jobs is primarily associated with Apple, not Microsoft, so the pronoun cannot be referring to him.

Therefore, based on the context and the information provided, ""he"" clearly refers to Bill Gates.",0,0
364,"Bill Gates is similar to Steve Jobs, but he is the previous CEO of Apple.",he,"0: Bill Gates, 1: Steve Jobs, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. The sentence mentions two people: Bill Gates and Steve Jobs.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the second part of the sentence.
3. The sentence states that ""he is the previous CEO of Apple.""
4. It's well-known that Steve Jobs was the CEO of Apple, not Bill Gates.
5. Bill Gates is famously associated with Microsoft, not Apple.
6. The sentence contains an error, as it incorrectly attributes being the previous CEO of Apple to the wrong person.

Despite the factual error in the sentence, we need to determine which person the pronoun ""he"" is intended to refer to based on the information given in the text. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" is referring back to the most recently mentioned person, which is Steve Jobs. The fact that the information is incorrect doesn't change the grammatical reference.

Therefore, based on the sentence structure and despite the factual inaccuracy, ""he"" most likely refers to Steve Jobs.",1,1
365,"Bill Clinton speaks better than George Bush, since he is a practiced orator.",he,"0: Bill Clinton, 1: George Bush, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Bill Clinton. The reasoning is as follows:

1. The sentence compares the speaking abilities of Bill Clinton and George Bush.
2. It states that Bill Clinton speaks better than George Bush.
3. The latter part of the sentence, ""since he is a practiced orator,"" provides an explanation for why one speaks better than the other.
4. Logically, this explanation would apply to the person who speaks better, which is Bill Clinton.
5. Therefore, ""he"" in ""he is a practiced orator"" refers to Bill Clinton.

The pronoun ""he"" is used to avoid repeating Bill Clinton's name and to maintain a smooth flow in the sentence while providing additional information about him.",0,0
366,"Bill Clinton speaks better than George Bush, since he is not a practiced orator.",he,"0: Bill Clinton, 1: George Bush, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to George Bush. The context suggests a comparison between Bill Clinton and George Bush's speaking abilities. The phrase ""since he is not a practiced orator"" is used to explain why Bill Clinton speaks better than George Bush.

367,Federer consistently beat Nadal since he was the better tennis player.,he,"0: Federer, 1: Nadal, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and meaning of the sentence:

1. The sentence states that ""Federer consistently beat Nadal.""
2. It then provides a reason for this: ""since he was the better tennis player.""
3. Logically, the person who consistently wins would be considered the better player.
4. Therefore, ""he"" in this context refers to Federer, as he is the one described as consistently beating Nadal and, by extension, being the better tennis player.

The pronoun ""he"" is used to avoid repeating Federer's name while explaining why he consistently won against Nadal. This is a common use of pronouns in English to maintain flow and avoid repetition.",0,0
368,Federer consistently beat Nadal since he was the worse tennis player.,he,"0: Federer, 1: Nadal, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and logic of the sentence:

1. The sentence states that ""Federer consistently beat Nadal.""
2. It then says ""since he was the worse tennis player.""
3. Logically, the worse tennis player would be the one who is consistently beaten.
4. Therefore, ""he"" in this context must refer to Nadal, as he is the one being consistently beaten by Federer.

The pronoun ""he"" cannot refer to Federer because it wouldn't make sense for Federer to consistently beat Nadal if Federer was the worse player. The sentence implies that the reason for Federer's consistent victories is that Nadal was the inferior player.",1,1
369,"Internet Explorer believes they have less security holes than Firefox, but they conducted the tests themselves.",they,"0: Internet Explorer, 1: Firefox, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" is used twice. Let's analyze each occurrence:

1. First ""they"": ""Internet Explorer believes they have less security holes than Firefox""
   This ""they"" refers to Internet Explorer. It's used as the subject of ""have less security holes,"" which is a claim attributed to Internet Explorer about itself.

2. Second ""they"": ""but they conducted the tests themselves""
   This ""they"" also refers to Internet Explorer. It's stating that Internet Explorer conducted the security tests, which explains why their claim might be biased.

Both instances of ""they"" refer to Internet Explorer, not Firefox. The sentence is discussing Internet Explorer's claims and actions, with Firefox only mentioned as a point of comparison.",0,0
370,"Internet Explorer believes they have less security holes than Firefox, but they do not trust Microsoft's test results.",they,"0: Internet Explorer, 1: Firefox, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun 'they' is used twice. The first 'they' refers to Internet Explorer, as it is the subject of the belief. The second 'they' also refers to Internet Explorer because it's continuing the same thought about Internet Explorer's perspective. Firefox is only mentioned as a comparison point and is not the subject of the sentence. Therefore, the pronoun 'they' refers to Internet Explorer.",1,0
371,President Clinton pardoned Roger Clinton because he wanted to free his half-brother.,he,"0: President Clinton, 1: Roger Clinton, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to President Clinton. The reasoning is as follows:

1. The sentence structure indicates that President Clinton is the subject performing the action of pardoning.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used to explain the motivation behind the pardoning action.
3. It makes logical sense that President Clinton would be the one wanting to free his half-brother, rather than Roger Clinton wanting to free himself.
4. The phrase ""his half-brother"" further confirms that ""he"" refers to President Clinton, as it's describing the relationship from President Clinton's perspective.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to President Clinton (candidate 0).",0,0
372,President Clinton pardoned Roger Clinton because he was the president's half-brother.,he,"0: President Clinton, 1: Roger Clinton, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions two people: President Clinton and Roger Clinton.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""because he was the president's half-brother.""
3. This clause explains the reason for President Clinton's action (pardoning).

375,Harley hides from Dyna because she is afraid of her.,she,"0: Harley, 1: Dyna, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence states that ""Harley hides from Dyna because she is afraid of her.""
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause explaining why Harley hides from Dyna.
3. It's logical that the one who is hiding is the one who is afraid.

377,Toyota has the luxury brand Lexus: they are built for the rich.,they,"0: Lexus, 1: Toyota, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" most likely refers to ""Lexus"" for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""they"" is referring to the subject that was most recently mentioned, which is Lexus.
2. The statement ""built for the rich"" aligns more closely with Lexus, which is described as a luxury brand, rather than Toyota, which is known for producing a wide range of vehicles including more affordable options.
3. It's more logical to say that a luxury brand (Lexus) is built for the rich, rather than the entire Toyota company, which produces vehicles for various market segments.

Therefore, the pronoun ""they"" most likely refers to Lexus.",0,0
378,"Toyota has the luxury brand Lexus, although they typically sell for the average consumer.",they,"0: Lexus, 1: Toyota, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" most likely refers to Toyota, not Lexus. The reasoning is as follows:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""they"" is referring to the main subject of the sentence, which is Toyota.
2. The statement ""although they typically sell for the average consumer"" is contrasting with the luxury brand Lexus. This implies that ""they"" is referring to Toyota's main line of vehicles, not the luxury Lexus brand.
3. It would be inconsistent to say that Lexus (a luxury brand) typically sells for the average consumer, so ""they"" cannot be referring to Lexus.

Therefore, the pronoun ""they"" most likely refers to Toyota and its main line of vehicles, which are generally more affordable and aimed at the average consumer, in contrast to their luxury brand Lexus.",1,1
379,"Batman constantly tries to arrest the Joker, but he is also a vigilante.",he,"0: Batman, 1: the Joker, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Batman for the following reasons:

1. Batman is the subject of the main clause and is mentioned first, making him the most prominent entity in the sentence.
2. The phrase ""but he is also a vigilante"" provides additional information about the subject of the sentence, which logically applies to Batman.
3. It's well-known that Batman is a vigilante, operating outside the law to fight crime, while the Joker is typically portrayed as a criminal, not a vigilante.
4. The structure of the sentence suggests that the information after ""but"" is contrasting or adding to the information about Batman, not the Joker.

Therefore, based on the context and sentence structure, ""he"" most likely refers to Batman.",0,0
380,"Batman constantly tried to arrest the Joker, but he always manages to get out.",he,"0: Batman, 1: the Joker, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to the Joker.

The first part of the sentence mentions Batman's attempts to arrest the Joker, while the second part, introduced by ""but,"" describes someone who ""always manages to get out."" This ability to escape is more logically attributed to the Joker, as he is the one being pursued and arrested. Therefore, ""he"" in this context refers to the Joker.",1,1
381,"Netflix recently split their DVD service to site Qwikster, but they quickly removed the move due to public backlash.",they,"0: Netflix, 1: Qwikster, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" is used twice. Let's analyze each instance:

1. ""Netflix recently split their DVD service to site Qwikster"" - Here, ""they"" refers to Netflix, as Netflix is the subject performing the action of splitting their DVD service.

2. ""but they quickly removed the move due to public backlash"" - In this part, ""they"" also refers to Netflix. Netflix is the entity that made the decision to remove the move (splitting the DVD service) in response to public backlash.

Throughout the sentence, ""they"" consistently refers to Netflix. Qwikster is mentioned as the new site for the DVD service, but it's not the subject performing any actions. Therefore, the pronoun ""they"" refers to Netflix (candidate 0).",0,0
382,"Netflix recently split their DVD service to site Qwikster, but they had a short lived life for the site.",they,"0: Netflix, 1: Qwikster, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" is used twice. Let's analyze each occurrence:

1. ""Netflix recently split their DVD service to site Qwikster"" - Here, ""their"" clearly refers to Netflix, as Netflix is the subject of the sentence and the owner of the DVD service.

2. ""but they had a short lived life for the site"" - This ""they"" is more ambiguous, but context suggests it also refers to Netflix. The sentence is describing Netflix's actions and decisions regarding the Qwikster site. It's more likely that Netflix had a short-lived plan for the site, rather than Qwikster itself having a short life (since Qwikster was the site being referred to).

Given that both instances of ""they"" in the sentence refer to Netflix, we can conclude that the pronoun ""they"" in this context refers to Netflix.",1,0
383,"Canada is bigger than the United Kingdom, but they do not have the population to back it up.",they,"0: Canada, 1: the United Kingdom, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and grammatical structure of the sentence.

1. The sentence compares Canada and the United Kingdom in terms of size and population.
2. ""They"" is used as a plural pronoun, which typically refers to multiple entities or a collective noun.
3. In this case, ""they"" is followed by ""do not have the population to back it up,"" which implies a comparison to the previously mentioned size.
4. Logically, this statement is referring to Canada, as it's saying that despite being bigger, Canada doesn't have a population to match its size compared to the United Kingdom.

Therefore, ""they"" most likely refers to Canada in this context.",0,0
384,"Canada is bigger than the United Kingdom, but they have a much larger population.",they,"0: Canada, 1: the United Kingdom, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" refers to ""the United Kingdom"" for the following reasons:

1. The sentence compares Canada and the United Kingdom in terms of size and population.
2. The first part of the sentence states that ""Canada is bigger than the United Kingdom.""
3. The second part, connected by ""but,"" introduces a contrasting fact about population.
4. Logically, if Canada is bigger, but ""they"" have a much larger population, ""they"" must refer to the United Kingdom.
5. It wouldn't make sense for ""they"" to refer to Canada, as that would not create a contrast with the first part of the sentence.

Therefore, ""they"" is used to refer to the United Kingdom, indicating that despite being smaller in size, the UK has a larger population than Canada.",1,1

1. The sentence structure suggests a contrast between Ray William Johnson and NigaHiga.
2. The first part of the sentence states that Ray William Johnson surpassed NigaHiga in subscribers.
3. The second part, introduced by ""but,"" indicates a different perspective or reaction to this situation.
4. The use of ""he considers"" implies that the subject (NigaHiga) is reflecting on his own position.
5. The phrase ""being number two is still a huge achievement"" makes sense in the context of NigaHiga's perspective, as he is the one who has been surpassed and is now in second place.

Therefore, it is most logical that ""he"" refers to NigaHiga, who is considering his new position as number two to be a significant achievement despite being surpassed.",1,1
388,"Ray William Johnson surpassed NigaHiga in Youtube subscribers, but he wants to increase the gap even more.",he,"0: Ray William Johnson, 1: NigaHiga, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Ray William Johnson.

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""they"" is the subject of the clause ""wanted to keep their workers happy at the company.""
2. The action of providing bonuses is attributed to ""The management"" at the beginning of the sentence.
3. The purpose of providing bonuses is to keep workers happy, which is typically a management responsibility.
4. ""The employees"" are the recipients of the bonuses and are referred to as ""their workers,"" indicating they are not the subject of ""they.""

Given these points, it's clear that ""they"" refers to ""The management."" The management is the entity that wants to keep the workers (employees) happy by providing bonuses.",0,0
390,The management provided bonuses to the employees since they need to be kept happy to stay productive.,they,"0: The management, 1: the employees, 2: Neither","In this sentence, 'they' refers to 'the employees' for several reasons:

391,The disease center quarantined the people since they were afraid of the outbreak spreading.,they,"0: The disease center, 1: the people, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and meaning of the sentence:

1. ""The disease center quarantined the people"" - This indicates an action taken by the disease center.
2. ""since they were afraid of the outbreak spreading"" - This part of the sentence explains the reason for the quarantine.

The pronoun ""they"" is more likely to refer to the disease center because:
a) The disease center is the subject of the main clause and the entity taking action.
b) It makes more sense for the disease center to be afraid of the outbreak spreading, as they are responsible for managing public health.
c) The people being quarantined are less likely to be the ones making the decision based on fear of the outbreak spreading.

Therefore, ""they"" most likely refers to ""The disease center"" (candidate 0).",0,0
392,The disease center quarantined the people because they may be infected.,they,"0: The disease center, 1: the people, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, let's analyze the sentence:

""The disease center quarantined the people because they may be infected.""

In this context, ""they"" is more likely to refer to ""the people"" for the following reasons:

1. Grammatical agreement: ""They"" is a plural pronoun, which matches with ""the people"" (plural) rather than ""The disease center"" (singular).

2. Logical sense: It's more logical that people would be infected and quarantined, rather than the disease center itself.

3. Sentence structure: The pronoun ""they"" is used in the clause explaining why the quarantine action was taken, which directly relates to the object of the main clause (the people), not the subject (the disease center).

393,The security team locked the scientists inside the building because they had to keep confidential information inside.,they,"0: The security team, 1: the scientists, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and logic of the sentence:

1. The sentence describes two groups: the security team and the scientists.
2. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the clause ""they had to keep confidential information inside.""
3. The action of keeping confidential information inside is more likely to be the responsibility of the security team rather than the scientists.
4. The security team is the subject of the main clause, which indicates they are the primary actors in this scenario.

396,The FDA revoked the medical licenses of corrupt doctors because they have been improperly issuing drugs.,they,"0: The FDA, 1: corrupt doctors, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" refers to the ""corrupt doctors"" for the following reasons:

1. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the plural form, which matches ""corrupt doctors"" (plural) rather than ""The FDA"" (singular).

2. The action described after ""they"" (improperly issuing drugs) is more likely to be associated with individual doctors rather than the FDA as a regulatory body.

3. The sentence structure suggests that the FDA's action (revoking medical licenses) is a response to the actions of the corrupt doctors (improperly issuing drugs).

4. It's more logical for corrupt doctors to be improperly issuing drugs than for the FDA to do so, as the FDA's role is to regulate and oversee, not to prescribe or issue drugs directly.

Therefore, the pronoun ""they"" most likely refers to the corrupt doctors.",1,1
397,Christian Bale once lost his temper at the man holding his lighting because he has a short temper.,he,"0: Christian Bale, 1: the man, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Christian Bale for the following reasons:

1. Christian Bale is the main subject of the sentence and is mentioned first, making him the most prominent entity.
2. The phrase ""he has a short temper"" is used to explain why Christian Bale lost his temper, which logically connects back to him rather than the lighting man.
3. The sentence is providing information about Christian Bale's character trait (having a short temper), which is more relevant to the main subject of the sentence rather than a secondary character (the man holding the lighting).

While it's technically possible that ""he"" could refer to the man holding the lighting, it's less likely given the context and structure of the sentence. The sentence is primarily about Christian Bale and his behavior, not about the lighting man's temperament.",0,0
398,"Christian Bale once lost his temper at the man holding his lighting, but he did not do anything that earned getting yelled at.",he,"0: Christian Bale, 1: the man, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""he"" refers to: Christian Bale or the man holding his lighting. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""but he did not do anything that earned getting yelled at."" 

Given the context of the sentence, it's more logical that this pronoun refers to the man holding the lighting, not Christian Bale. The sentence structure suggests a contrast: Christian Bale lost his temper at the man, BUT the man didn't do anything to deserve it. 

If ""he"" referred to Christian Bale, the sentence wouldn't make much sense, as it would imply Christian Bale yelled at himself or that his own actions didn't warrant his own outburst.

Therefore, ""he"" most likely refers to ""the man holding his lighting.""",1,1
399,Andrea threw a promotion party in honor of Lindsay since she recently got promoted.,she,"0: Andrea, 1: Lindsay, 2: Neither","To determine who the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. Andrea threw a promotion party.
2. The party was in honor of Lindsay.
3. The reason for the party was that ""she"" recently got promoted.

Given this information, it's more logical that the pronoun ""she"" refers to Lindsay. The sentence implies that the promotion party was thrown for Lindsay because Lindsay was the one who got promoted. It wouldn't make sense for Andrea to throw a party for Lindsay if Andrea herself was the one who got promoted.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Lindsay.",1,1
400,Andrea threw a promotion party in honor of Lindsay because she wanted to do something special for her.,she,"0: Andrea, 1: Lindsay, 2: Neither","To determine who ""she"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and the logical flow of the sentence.

1. Andrea threw a promotion party for Lindsay.
2. The party was thrown ""because she wanted to do something special for her.""

The pronoun ""she"" is more likely to refer to Andrea for the following reasons:
1. Andrea is the subject of the main clause and the one performing the action (throwing the party).
2. The phrase ""wanted to do something special for her"" implies that the subject (she) is doing something for someone else (her).
3. It makes more sense that Andrea wanted to do something special for Lindsay (the person being promoted) rather than Lindsay wanting to do something special for herself.

Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Andrea in this context.",0,0
401,Michael Phelps was fined by Judge Louis because he was caught with illegal drugs.,he,"0: Michael Phelps, 1: Judge Louis, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Michael Phelps. The context of the sentence indicates that someone was fined for being caught with illegal drugs, and Michael Phelps is the subject of this action. The sentence structure suggests that Michael Phelps is the one who was caught with illegal drugs and subsequently fined by Judge Louis. Judge Louis is mentioned as the one imposing the fine, not the one being fined or caught with drugs.",0,0
402,Michael Phelps was fined by Judge Louis because he has to uphold federal law.,he,"0: Michael Phelps, 1: Judge Louis, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who the pronoun ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Michael Phelps was fined by Judge Louis
2. ""he has to uphold federal law""

The pronoun ""he"" is more likely to refer to Judge Louis for the following reasons:
1. Judges are typically responsible for upholding the law, not the person being fined.
2. It makes more sense in the context that a judge would have to uphold federal law as part of their job duties.
3. The sentence structure suggests that the reason for the fine is explained after the comma, and it's logical that the judge's obligation to uphold the law is the reason for fining Michael Phelps.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Judge Louis.",1,1
403,Lloyd traded his truck to Roger for his motorcycle since he wanted to have a truck.,he,"0: Lloyd, 1: Roger, 2: Neither","To determine who the pronoun ""he"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and logic of the statement.

1. The sentence states that Lloyd traded his truck to Roger for Roger's motorcycle.
2. The reason given for this trade is that ""he wanted to have a truck.""
3. Since Lloyd is giving away his truck, it wouldn't make sense for him to be the one who wants a truck.
4. Therefore, the person who wants to have a truck must be Roger.

The pronoun ""he"" in this context refers to Roger, as he is the one who wanted to have a truck, which is why the trade took place.",1,1
404,Lloyd traded his truck to Roger for his motorcycle since he preferred a small vehicle.,he,"0: Lloyd, 1: Roger, 2: Neither","To determine who the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence describes a trade between Lloyd and Roger.
2. Lloyd traded his truck for Roger's motorcycle.
3. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""since he preferred a small vehicle.""
4. A motorcycle is generally considered a smaller vehicle compared to a truck.

Given this information, it's logical to conclude that ""he"" refers to Lloyd. Lloyd is the one who traded his truck for a motorcycle, which aligns with the statement about preferring a small vehicle. It wouldn't make sense for Roger to prefer a small vehicle while trading away his motorcycle for a truck.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Lloyd.",0,0
405,The hotel staff tended to the royal family since they needed to keep them satisfied as occupants.,they,"0: The hotel staff, 1: the royal family, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, let's analyze the sentence:

""The hotel staff tended to the royal family since they needed to keep them satisfied as occupants.""

In this context, ""they"" is more likely to refer to ""The hotel staff"" for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure suggests that the subject (hotel staff) is performing an action (tending to the royal family) for a reason.
2. The pronoun ""they"" is followed by ""needed to keep them satisfied,"" where ""them"" clearly refers to the royal family.
3. It makes more logical sense that the hotel staff would need to keep the royal family satisfied, rather than the royal family needing to keep themselves satisfied.
4. The phrase ""as occupants"" further supports that the royal family are the guests, and the hotel staff are the ones responsible for their satisfaction.

Therefore, ""they"" most likely refers to ""The hotel staff"" (candidate 0).",0,0
406,"The hotel staff tended to the royal family, however, they felt the service was unsatisfactory.",they,"0: The hotel staff, 1: the royal family, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and meaning of the sentence:

1. The sentence describes two groups: the hotel staff and the royal family.
2. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the clause ""they felt the service was unsatisfactory.""
3. It's more logical that the royal family would be the ones evaluating the service, not the hotel staff evaluating their own service.
4. The use of ""however"" indicates a contrast between the first part of the sentence (hotel staff tending to the royal family) and the second part (dissatisfaction with the service).

Based on these points, it's most likely that ""they"" refers to the royal family, as they would be the ones receiving and evaluating the service.",1,1
407,"Donald Trump fired his servant, Luigi, because he felt his service was below average.",he,"0: Donald Trump, 1: Luigi, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence is about Donald Trump firing Luigi.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""because he felt his service was below average.""
3. The action of feeling that the service was below average is more likely to be associated with the person doing the firing (Donald Trump) rather than the person being fired (Luigi).
4. It would make more sense for Donald Trump to fire Luigi because Trump felt Luigi's service was below average, rather than Luigi feeling his own service was below average.

Based on this analysis, it is most logical that ""he"" refers to Donald Trump in this context.",0,0
408,"Donald Trump fired his servant, Luigi, but he can find another job elsewhere.",he,"0: Donald Trump, 1: Luigi, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and logical flow of the sentence:

1. The sentence starts with ""Donald Trump fired his servant, Luigi"".
2. The second part of the sentence, after the comma, says ""but he can find another job elsewhere"".

Given this information:
- Donald Trump is the one doing the firing, so he already has a job and wouldn't need to find another one.
- Luigi is the one who was fired, so he would be the one who needs to find another job.

The pronoun ""he"" in this context logically refers to Luigi, as he is the one who would need to find another job after being fired.",1,1
409,The teaching staff wanted to treat the students to a special lunch because they did so well on their standardized tests.,they,"0: The teaching staff, 1: the students, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, let's analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence mentions two groups: the teaching staff and the students.
2. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the clause ""because they did so well on their standardized tests.""
3. Typically, students take standardized tests, not teaching staff.
4. The teaching staff wanted to treat the students as a result of this good performance.

Based on this analysis, it's clear that ""they"" refers to the students. The students are the ones who performed well on the standardized tests, which prompted the teaching staff to want to treat them to a special lunch.",1,1
410,The teaching staff wanted to treat the students to a special lunch but they did not have enough money in the budget.,they,"0: The teaching staff, 1: the students, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and logic of the sentence:

1. The sentence starts with ""The teaching staff wanted to treat the students to a special lunch.""
2. The second part of the sentence, introduced by ""but,"" provides a contrasting or limiting factor: ""they did not have enough money in the budget.""

Logically, the group that would be concerned about having enough money in the budget for treating the students to lunch would be the teaching staff, not the students themselves. The students are the recipients of the potential treat, not the ones responsible for budgeting or providing it.

Therefore, ""they"" most likely refers to ""The teaching staff"" as they are the ones who would be checking the budget and making decisions about special treats for students.",0,0
411,Some actors choose to perform their own stunts instead of using stunt doubles since they like to keep it as authentic as possible.,they,"0: Some actors, 1: stunt doubles, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" refers to ""Some actors"" for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure indicates that ""Some actors"" is the subject of the main clause.
2. The pronoun ""they"" is used to continue discussing the actions and preferences of these actors.
3. The phrase ""instead of using stunt doubles"" creates a contrast between the actors and the stunt doubles, indicating that ""they"" refers to the actors, not the stunt doubles.
4. The sentence is explaining the motivation of the actors (""they like to keep it as authentic as possible""), which logically connects back to the subject ""Some actors.""

Therefore, the pronoun ""they"" clearly refers to ""Some actors"" (candidate 0) and not to ""stunt doubles"" (candidate 1).",0,0
412,Some actors choose to perform their own stunts instead of using stunt doubles although they are professionals who specialize in stunts.,they,"0: Some actors, 1: stunt doubles, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" refers to ""stunt doubles"" for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure indicates that ""they"" is referring to the subject mentioned immediately before it.
2. The phrase ""although they are professionals who specialize in stunts"" is providing additional information about stunt doubles, not actors.
3. It would be redundant to say that actors are professionals who specialize in stunts, as that's not typically their primary role.
4. The sentence is contrasting actors who choose to do their own stunts with stunt doubles who are professionals in that specific field.

Therefore, ""they"" is most likely referring to ""stunt doubles"" in this context.",1,1

1. Subject-verb agreement: The pronoun ""they"" is used as the subject of the clause ""they are paid professionals in their field,"" which aligns with ""Tatoo artists"" being the main subject of the sentence.

2. Logical context: The sentence is describing the specialization and professional status of tattoo artists, not their customers. It makes more sense for tattoo artists to be referred to as ""paid professionals in their field"" rather than their customers.

3. Sentence structure: The first part of the sentence introduces tattoo artists as the main subject, and the second part (after the comma) provides additional information about them using the pronoun ""they.""

Therefore, the pronoun ""they"" most likely refers to ""Tatoo artists"" (candidate 0) in this context.",0,0

415,The drug cartel enlists the help of the local population to work their fields since they are considered cheap labor.,they,"0: The drug cartel, 1: the local population, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence is about the drug cartel enlisting help from the local population.
2. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the clause ""since they are considered cheap labor.""
3. Logically, it makes more sense that the local population would be considered cheap labor, not the drug cartel.
4. The structure of the sentence suggests that ""they"" refers to the most recently mentioned noun phrase, which is ""the local population.""

Based on these observations, it's clear that ""they"" refers to ""the local population"" rather than ""the drug cartel.""",1,1
416,The drug cartel enlists the help of the local population to work their fields since they need cheap labor to maximize their profits.,they,"0: The drug cartel, 1: the local population, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence begins with ""The drug cartel"" as the subject.
2. The drug cartel is described as enlisting help from the local population.
3. The pronoun ""they"" appears in the clause ""they need cheap labor.""
4. The need for cheap labor is logically connected to the drug cartel's goal of maximizing profits.

Based on this analysis, ""they"" most likely refers to ""The drug cartel"" because:
- The drug cartel is the main subject of the sentence.
- The need for cheap labor and maximizing profits aligns with the actions and motivations of a drug cartel.
- It wouldn't make sense for ""they"" to refer to ""the local population"" in this context, as the local population is being enlisted to work, not seeking cheap labor.

Therefore, the pronoun ""they"" refers to candidate 0: The drug cartel.",0,0
417,"The Samurais respected honor while pirates have a disregard for honor, because they hold true to the policy of fighting with honor.",they,"0: The Samurais, 1: pirates, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" refers to the Samurais, not the pirates. The reasoning is as follows:

1. The sentence contrasts the Samurais' respect for honor with the pirates' disregard for honor.
2. The latter part of the sentence, ""because they hold true to the policy of fighting with honor,"" is explaining why the Samurais respect honor.
3. The phrase ""fighting with honor"" aligns with the Samurais' reputation and values, not with the pirates who are described as having a disregard for honor.
4. Grammatically, ""they"" is more likely to refer to the subject of the main clause (The Samurais) rather than the object of a prepositional phrase (pirates).

The context of the sentence indicates that the subject being described as having ""a disregard for honor"" and being ""only interested in increasing their wealth"" is contrasted with the Samurais, who are described as respecting honor.

2. The main subject of the sentence is JP Morgan Bank, as they are the ones who developed the mobile banking application.
3. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the context of appealing to consumers who want accessible banking.

1. The sentence structure suggests a contrast between JP Morgan Bank and Bank of America.
2. JP Morgan Bank is mentioned as having already developed a mobile banking application.
3. The phrase ""but they will probably develop their own mobile application soon as well"" implies that the subject (they) hasn't yet developed a mobile application, in contrast to JP Morgan Bank.
4. It makes logical sense that Bank of America, as a competitor, would develop their own mobile application in response to JP Morgan Bank's edge.

Therefore, ""they"" in this context refers to Bank of America.",1,1

1. Subject-verb agreement: ""The Russian Syndicate"" is the main subject of the sentence, and ""they"" is used as the subject of the second clause. This grammatical structure suggests that ""they"" refers back to the main subject.

2. Logical context: The sentence describes an action (removing lower members) that would typically be carried out by the organization itself, not by the lower members being removed.

3. Possessive pronoun: The use of ""their"" in ""their lower members"" and ""their operations"" indicates that the Russian Syndicate owns or controls these elements, further supporting that ""they"" refers to the Syndicate.

4. Semantic coherence: It makes more sense for the Russian Syndicate to be making decisions about its own structure and secrecy, rather than the lower members making such decisions.

Therefore, the pronoun ""they"" most likely refers to ""The Russian Syndicate"" (candidate 0).",0,"0

["
422,The Russian Syndicate decided to remove some of their lower members because they knew too much about their operations.,they,"0: The Russian Syndicate, 1: their lower members, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""The Russian Syndicate"" as the main subject.

3. The action of knowing too much about operations logically applies to the lower members, not the Russian Syndicate itself.
4. The Russian Syndicate is making a decision based on what ""they"" (the lower members) know.

423,The SWAT team moved in on the compound to prevent the terrorists from launching a deadly missile because they wanted to preserve the lives of innocents.,they,"0: The SWAT team, 1: the terrorists, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and logical flow of the sentence.

The sentence describes two groups: the SWAT team and the terrorists. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the clause ""they wanted to preserve the lives of innocents."" We need to consider which group's actions and motivations align with this desire.

1. The SWAT team: Their action of moving in on the compound is described as being done ""to prevent the terrorists from launching a deadly missile."" This action is consistent with wanting to preserve innocent lives.

2. The terrorists: They are described as planning to launch a deadly missile, which is an action that would harm innocent lives, not preserve them.

Given this analysis, it is clear that the pronoun ""they"" refers to the SWAT team. The desire to preserve innocent lives aligns with the SWAT team's actions and is contrary to the terrorists' intentions.",0,0

1. The sentence compares speed boats and row boats in terms of safety regulations.
2. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the clause ""since they are more prone to mechanical failures due to their moving parts.""
3. Logically, speed boats are more likely to have mechanical failures due to their moving parts, as they have engines and other complex mechanisms.
4. Row boats, on the other hand, are simpler in design and typically don't have mechanical parts that could fail.
5. The sentence structure suggests that the pronoun ""they"" refers to the subject that needs strict tests, which are the speed boats.

1. Michael decided to freeze himself in cryo-stasis.

The pronoun ""he"" is more likely to refer to Michael's father because:
1. The father is the last mentioned person before the pronoun ""he"" appears.
2. It makes more sense in the context that the father would try to convince Michael not to freeze himself, given that the father was against it.

The research studies are only mentioned as the source of the information, not as the entity consuming bandwidth.",1,1
434,"Research studies recently revealed that Netflix consumes over 37 percent of the world's internet bandwidth, but they may not be entirely accurate now due to recent changes in Netflix subscribers.",they,"0: Research studies, 1: Netflix, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and grammatical structure of the sentence.

1. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the phrase ""they may not be entirely accurate now"".
2. This phrase is referring to something that was previously mentioned in the sentence.
3. The sentence begins by discussing ""Research studies"" that revealed information about Netflix's internet bandwidth consumption.
4. The use of ""they"" suggests that the subject being referred to is plural.
5. ""Research studies"" is plural and fits grammatically as the subject that ""they"" is referring to.
6. Netflix, while it can sometimes be treated as a plural entity, is more commonly referred to as a singular entity (it), especially in this context.

Based on these observations, it is most logical and grammatically correct that ""they"" refers to ""Research studies"".",0,0
435,Captain Picard tends to confide in Commander Riker since he wants to ensure he develops into a fine captain one day.,he,"0: Captain Picard, 1: Commander Riker, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which 'he' the pronoun refers to. The sentence structure suggests that 'he' refers to Captain Picard for the following reasons:

1. Captain Picard is the subject of the main clause and the one performing the action of confiding.
2. The phrase 'he wants to ensure' is more likely to refer to Captain Picard's desire to develop Riker, rather than Riker wanting to develop himself.
3. The sentence implies a mentorship dynamic, with Picard as the senior officer helping to develop Riker.

Therefore, it's most logical that 'he' refers to Captain Picard, who wants to ensure that Commander Riker develops into a fine captain.",0,0

The key to understanding this is the context of the sentence.

The sentence states that ""Captain Picard tends to confide in Commander Riker because he needs to soak up as much experience as he can."" 

Logically, it makes more sense that the person needing to gain experience would be the one seeking advice or confiding in someone else. In this case, it's more likely that Commander Riker, being in a lower rank, would be the one needing to gain experience from Captain Picard.

However, the sentence structure clearly indicates that it's Captain Picard who is confiding in Commander Riker. This suggests that, contrary to what might be expected, it's actually Captain Picard who is trying to gain experience.

Therefore, ""he"" in this context refers to Captain Picard.",1,0

This is evident from the context of the sentence, which is comparing Data's learning abilities to those of Wesley. The sentence states that ""he has the ability to learn vasts amount of information quickly into his database,"" which is clearly referring to Data's android capabilities. Wesley, being human, does not have a database for storing information. Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" is used to refer back to Data, who is the main subject of the sentence.",0,0

The context indicates that Data can learn new materials much faster than Wesley, and then provides a reason why Wesley cannot learn as quickly. The phrase ""because he does not have an electronic brain to learn as quickly"" is describing Wesley, contrasting him with Data who is an android and presumably does have an electronic brain. Therefore, ""he"" in this context refers to Acting Ensign Wesley.",1,1
439,The Next Generation was well received by Trekkies because they stayed true to the roots established in the first Star Trek.,they,"0: The Next Generation, 1: Trekkies, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. ""The Next Generation"" is the subject of the main clause.
2. ""Trekkies"" is mentioned as the group who received the show well.
3. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the subordinate clause ""because they stayed true to the roots...""

Given this analysis, ""they"" most likely refers to the creators or producers of ""The Next Generation"" rather than the Trekkies. The sentence is explaining why the show was well-received, implying that the show's creators (represented by ""The Next Generation"" as a metonym) stayed true to the original Star Trek's roots.

Therefore, ""they"" refers to ""The Next Generation"" (representing the show's creators), not the Trekkies or any other entity not mentioned in the candidates.",0,0

1. ""They"" is used as a subject pronoun in the clause ""they have much demand for this particular dish.""
2. The subject of this clause needs to be an entity capable of having or experiencing demand.
3. Pei Wei is a restaurant chain, which can experience demand for its dishes.
4. Sesame chicken is a dish and cannot have demand for itself.
5. The sentence structure suggests that Pei Wei (the restaurant) is selling sesame chicken because there is high demand for it.

Therefore, ""they"" logically refers to Pei Wei, the restaurant chain.",0,0

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""they"" is referring to the object of the first clause, which is ""sesame chicken.""
2. The context implies that sesame chicken is frequently ordered, not that Pei Wei (the restaurant) is picked as an order.
3. It makes more logical sense for a dish to be ""constantly picked as an order"" rather than a restaurant.

Therefore, the pronoun ""they"" most likely refers to ""sesame chicken.""",1,1

2. It's more logical that a mother would be accused of being a terrible mother, rather than a daughter.
3. The pronoun ""she"" is used in contrast to ""her daughter,"" indicating that it refers to a different person.
4. ""Lois"" is the main subject of the sentence and the person being scolded, which aligns with being accused of being a terrible mother.

1. The first ""she"" in ""so she thought"" is more likely to refer to Lois because:
   - Lois is the main subject of the sentence.
   - It's more natural for the person who was scolded (Lois) to reflect on how to improve.

2. The second ""she"" in ""how she could be better"" also refers to the same person as the first ""she,"" which we've determined is likely Lois.

3. It wouldn't make sense for the daughter to think about how she could be better after scolding her mother.

Therefore, both instances of ""she"" in this sentence most likely refer to Lois.",1,0

1. The sentence is about the victims of the Black Plague blaming witches for the curse.
2. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the clause ""they did not understand diseases at the time.""
3. This lack of understanding is more likely to be attributed to the general population or the victims of the plague, rather than the witches who were being blamed.
4. It wouldn't make sense for the sentence to say that the witches didn't understand diseases, as this information is not relevant to the main point of the sentence.
5. The victims of the Black Plague are the subject of the main clause, making them the most likely antecedent for the pronoun ""they.""

- The false accusation mentioned at the end is more likely to be about the witches, as they were the ones being blamed.

3. The priests are mentioned as a secondary party in the sentence, not as the main actors. They are the ones for whom the girl is being transported, rather than the ones doing the transporting.

4. The pardoning mentioned at the end of the sentence makes more sense if it applies to the crusaders, who are described as ""deserted,"" implying they may need pardoning for their desertion.

1. The sentence mentions two male individuals: King James and Prince Henry.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""he was expected to propose to his daughter.""
3. It's more logical that Prince Henry would be the one expected to propose to King James's daughter, rather than King James proposing to his own daughter.
4. The sentence structure suggests that Prince Henry's arrival is being awaited for a specific reason, which is likely the expected proposal.

Based on these points, it's most reasonable to conclude that ""he"" refers to Prince Henry, as he is the one expected to propose to King James's daughter.",1,1

1. The sentence describes two actions:
   a) Crusader Andrews saved Crusader Christopher's life
   b) Someone thanked someone else

472,"Planet 343's sandstorm forces the inhabitants underground, but they have plenty of food sources stored away.",they,"0: Planet 343's sandstorm, 1: the inhabitants, 2: Neither","The pronoun ""they"" in this sentence refers to ""the inhabitants"" of Planet 343. This is evident because:

1. ""They"" is a plural pronoun, which matches with the plural noun ""inhabitants.""
2. The context of the sentence suggests that it's the inhabitants who have food sources stored away, not the sandstorm.
3. It wouldn't make sense for a sandstorm to have food sources or to go underground.
4. The sentence structure indicates that ""they"" is referring back to the subject that is forced underground, which is ""the inhabitants.""

Therefore, the pronoun ""they"" clearly refers to ""the inhabitants"" (candidate 1) and not to ""Planet 343's sandstorm"" (candidate 0) or any other entity not mentioned in the candidates.",1,1
473,The Marines are considerably afraid of the aliens because they are known to hunt down humans.,they,"0: The Marines, 1: the aliens, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" refers to ""the aliens"" for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""they"" is the subject of the clause ""are known to hunt down humans.""
2. It wouldn't make sense for ""The Marines"" to be known for hunting down humans, as they are humans themselves.
3. The context implies that the aliens are the source of fear for the Marines, which aligns with the aliens being known to hunt humans.
4. Grammatically, ""they"" is more likely to refer to the noun phrase closest to it, which in this case is ""the aliens.""

Therefore, the pronoun ""they"" most logically refers to ""the aliens"" (candidate 1).",1,1
474,"The Marines are considerably afraid of the aliens, but they will still use their discipline to overcome their fears.",they,"0: The Marines, 1: the aliens, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" is used twice. Let's analyze each instance:

1. ""...but they will still use their discipline...""
This ""they"" clearly refers to the Marines. The sentence is contrasting their fear with their disciplined response, which is a characteristic we would associate with trained military personnel like Marines.

2. ""...to overcome their fears.""
This ""their"" also refers to the Marines, as it's talking about overcoming the fears mentioned at the beginning of the sentence.

The aliens are only mentioned as the object of the Marines' fear, not as the subject performing any actions. Therefore, both instances of ""they"" in this sentence refer to the Marines.",0,0
475,The children learned how to kill poisonous snakes from the adults since they have experience surviving in the outdoors.,they,"0: The children, 1: the adults, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and meaning of the sentence:

1. The sentence is about children learning from adults about killing poisonous snakes.
2. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the clause ""since they have experience surviving in the outdoors.""
3. The logical interpretation is that the adults are the ones with experience surviving in the outdoors, not the children who are learning.
4. It makes more sense for the adults to have the experience, as they are teaching the children.

Based on this analysis, ""they"" most likely refers to ""the adults"" in this context.",1,1
476,The children learned how to kill poisonous snakes from the adults so they can also survive in the wild by themselves.,they,"0: The children, 1: the adults, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" most likely refers to ""The children"" for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""they"" is the subject of the second part of the sentence, which is a continuation of the action initiated by ""The children"" in the first part.

2. The context implies that the children are learning a survival skill from the adults, and the purpose of this learning is for the children to be able to survive on their own.

3. The phrase ""can also survive"" indicates that the subject of this clause (they) is gaining the ability to survive, which aligns with the children learning from the adults.

4. It would be redundant and less logical for ""they"" to refer to the adults, as the adults are already teaching the skill and presumably already know how to survive in the wild.

Therefore, the pronoun ""they"" most likely refers to ""The children"" in this context.",0,0
477,The public school board of educators initiated a physical education plan on the students since they scored so low on the health and fitness standardized test.,they,"0: The public school board of educators, 1: the students, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence mentions two groups: ""The public school board of educators"" and ""the students.""
2. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the clause ""they scored so low on the health and fitness standardized test.""
3. It's more logical that students would take a health and fitness standardized test, rather than the school board of educators.
4. The low scores on the test are given as the reason for initiating a physical education plan, which would be aimed at improving students' health and fitness.

Based on this analysis, it's clear that ""they"" refers to ""the students"" rather than ""The public school board of educators.""",1,1
478,The public school board of educators initiated a physical education plan on the students so that they could help them become healthy again.,they,"0: The public school board of educators, 1: the students, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine what ""they"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. ""The public school board of educators"" initiated a plan.
2. The plan was ""on the students"".
3. The purpose was to ""help them become healthy again"".

The pronoun ""they"" is used in the phrase ""so that they could help them"". This implies that ""they"" refers to the group doing the helping, not the group being helped. 

The public school board of educators are the ones initiating the plan and would be in the position to help the students. The students are the ones being helped to become healthy again.

Therefore, ""they"" most likely refers to ""The public school board of educators"".",0,0
479,Range Rover recently revealed their new lineup of cars at Times Square for thousands of New Yorkers since they are advertising their new high end models.,they,"0: Range Rover, 1: thousands of New Yorkers, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" refers to Range Rover. The context indicates that Range Rover is the subject performing the action of advertising their new high-end models. The phrase ""they are advertising their new high end models"" clearly refers to Range Rover's actions, not to the thousands of New Yorkers who are merely spectators in this scenario. The use of ""their"" in relation to the new lineup of cars and new high-end models also supports that ""they"" refers to Range Rover.",0,0
480,Range Rover recently revealed their new lineup of cars at Times Square for thousands of New Yorkers so they would be enticed to purchase their cars.,they,"0: Range Rover, 1: thousands of New Yorkers, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" most likely refers to ""thousands of New Yorkers"" for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure suggests that Range Rover revealed their cars to the New Yorkers for a specific purpose.
2. The purpose is stated as ""so they would be enticed to purchase their cars.""
3. It makes more logical sense for the New Yorkers to be the ones enticed to purchase the cars, rather than Range Rover being enticed to purchase their own cars.
4. The pronoun ""they"" is closer in proximity to ""thousands of New Yorkers"" than to ""Range Rover,"" which also supports this interpretation.

Therefore, ""they"" refers to the thousands of New Yorkers who were the target audience of Range Rover's car reveal.",1,1
481,Raiden could not follow and guide Liu Kang in the world of darkness since he could not enter this realm without breaking the rules.,he,"0: Raiden, 1: Liu Kang, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions two characters: Raiden and Liu Kang.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""he could not enter this realm.""
3. The main clause states that ""Raiden could not follow and guide Liu Kang.""
4. The reason given for this inability is that ""he could not enter this realm.""

Given this analysis, it's clear that the pronoun ""he"" refers to Raiden because:
a) Raiden is the subject of the main clause.
b) The inability to enter the realm is presented as the reason why Raiden couldn't follow and guide Liu Kang.
c) It wouldn't make sense for Liu Kang to be the one who couldn't enter the realm, as the sentence implies he is already in or going to that realm.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Raiden.",0,0
482,"Raiden could not follow and guide Liu Kang in the world of darkness, but he will be able to find another guide instead.",he,"0: Raiden, 1: Liu Kang, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Liu Kang. The context suggests that Raiden cannot guide Liu Kang in the world of darkness, but ""he"" (Liu Kang) will be able to find another guide instead. This interpretation makes the most logical sense because:

1. The sentence starts by mentioning what Raiden cannot do for Liu Kang.
2. The second part of the sentence, connected by ""but,"" implies a solution or alternative for the person who needs guidance.
3. It would be more natural for Liu Kang, who needs guidance, to find another guide, rather than Raiden finding another guide for himself.

Therefore, ""he"" in this context most likely refers to Liu Kang.",1,1

""Banks usually offer bonus points for new credit card applicants since they want them to specifically bank with them.""

In this context, ""they"" is referring to the subject of the sentence, which is ""Banks."" The sentence is explaining the motivation behind banks offering bonus points, which is that banks (they) want new credit card applicants to choose their banking services.

It wouldn't make sense for ""they"" to refer to ""new credit card applicants"" because the sentence is describing the actions and motivations of the banks, not the applicants.

Therefore, the pronoun ""they"" refers to ""Banks"" in this sentence.",0,0
484,Banks usually offer bonus points for new credit card applicants because they are often enticed by free offerings.,they,"0: Banks, 1: new credit card applicants, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence is about banks offering bonus points to new credit card applicants.
2. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the clause ""because they are often enticed by free offerings.""
3. Logically, it makes more sense that new credit card applicants would be enticed by free offerings, rather than banks.
4. Banks are the ones offering the bonus points, so they wouldn't be enticed by their own offerings.

1. The sentence describes an action performed by Hair Stylists on the Cowboy's Cheerleaders.
2. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the clause ""since they need to look top notch for the game.""
3. Logically, it's the Cheerleaders who need to look good for the game, not the Hair Stylists.
4. The phrase ""transformed... into beauties"" also implies that the Cheerleaders are the ones who need to look good.
5. It wouldn't make sense for the Hair Stylists to need to look top notch for the game in this context.

Therefore, the pronoun ""they"" most likely refers to ""the Cowboy's Cheerleaders"" (candidate 1).",1,1
486,"Hair Stylists transformed the Cowboy's Cheerleaders into beauties, so they put much product into their hair.",they,"0: Hair Stylists, 1: the Cowboy's Cheerleaders, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, let's analyze the sentence:

1. The sentence structure suggests two separate actions:
   a) Hair Stylists transformed the Cowboy's Cheerleaders into beauties
   b) They put much product into their hair

2. The pronoun ""they"" is used as the subject of the second action.

3. It's more logical that the Hair Stylists would be the ones putting product into the Cheerleaders' hair, as they are the professionals responsible for the transformation.

4. The use of ""so"" indicates a cause-and-effect relationship, implying that the Hair Stylists' actions (transforming the Cheerleaders) led to the next action (putting product in their hair).

Given this analysis, it's most likely that ""they"" refers to the Hair Stylists, as they would be the ones applying hair products as part of their job in transforming the Cheerleaders.",0,0
487,The patrons enjoyed the food made by the chefs immensely because they made the food with exquisite sauces.,they,"0: The patrons, 1: the chefs, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and meaning of the sentence:

1. The sentence is about food being enjoyed by patrons and made by chefs.
2. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the clause ""they made the food with exquisite sauces.""
3. The act of making food is typically associated with chefs, not patrons.
4. The use of ""exquisite sauces"" further supports that the subject is the chefs, as creating sauces is a culinary skill.
5. It wouldn't make sense for the patrons to be making the food they're enjoying in a context where chefs are mentioned.

Based on this analysis, it's clear that ""they"" refers to ""the chefs"" (candidate 1) and not ""The patrons"" (candidate 0).",1,1
488,"The patrons enjoyed the food made by the chefs immensely, so they paid very well to enjoy this meal.",they,"0: The patrons, 1: the chefs, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and logic of the sentence:

1. The sentence describes two groups: the patrons and the chefs.
2. The first part of the sentence states that ""The patrons enjoyed the food made by the chefs immensely.""
3. The second part, connected by ""so,"" indicates an action taken as a result of enjoying the food: ""they paid very well to enjoy this meal.""

Logically, the group that would pay for the meal would be the patrons, not the chefs. Chefs typically prepare the food and are paid for their work, while patrons are the ones who pay for the meal they enjoy.

1. Beowulf is the main subject of the sentence and is mentioned first.
2. The sentence structure indicates that Beowulf is the one taking action: he arrived to slay Grendell and he went out with his men.
3. The phrase ""he and his men"" suggests a leader figure, which aligns with Beowulf's role as the hero coming to save the kingdom.
4. Grendell is mentioned as the object of Beowulf's action (to slay), not as the one performing actions in this sentence.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Beowulf.",0,0

1. The sentence structure suggests that the information after the comma is providing additional details about Grendell, not Beowulf.
2. The phrase ""difficult to slay"" implies that ""he"" is the target of the slaying, which aligns with Grendell's role as the monster Beowulf came to defeat.
3. The mention of ""demon magic"" is more likely to be associated with Grendell, the antagonist, rather than Beowulf, the hero.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" in this context is most likely referring to Grendell.",1,1

3. The phrase ""disgruntled users"" is closer to the pronoun ""they"" in the sentence, which often indicates the pronoun's referent.
4. The sentence is explaining why PayPal has to settle disputes, implying that the users (they) are the ones initiating these disputes due to being victims of fraud.

493,The slaves were forced to do the bidding of the nobles since they have no rights.,they,"0: The slaves, 1: the nobles, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" most likely refers to ""The slaves"" for the following reasons:

1. Grammatical agreement: ""they"" is a plural pronoun, which agrees with the plural noun ""slaves.""

2. Logical context: The sentence describes a power dynamic between slaves and nobles. The clause ""since they have no rights"" provides an explanation for why the slaves were forced to obey the nobles. It makes more sense that the slaves would have no rights, as opposed to the nobles who are in a position of power.

3. Sentence structure: The slaves are mentioned first in the sentence, making them the primary subject. It's more natural for the pronoun to refer back to the main subject of the sentence.

4. Historical context: In societies with slavery, it was typically the slaves who had no rights, not the nobles.

Therefore, the pronoun ""they"" most likely refers to ""The slaves"" in this context.",0,0

2. The first part of the sentence states that ""The slaves were forced to do the bidding of the nobles.""
3. The second part of the sentence, which contains the pronoun ""they,"" says ""so they do not have to do any of the hard labor.""

Given this information, we can deduce that:
- The slaves are the ones being forced to do the bidding and hard labor.
- The nobles are the ones making the slaves do their bidding.
- The pronoun ""they"" is referring to the group that doesn't have to do the hard labor.

Therefore, ""they"" must be referring to the nobles, as they are the ones benefiting from the slaves' work and not having to do the hard labor themselves.",1,1

2. This clause provides the reason for the action described in the main clause.
3. The main clause states that ""Scientists have created a serum.""
4. Logically, the ones who needed to create an unstoppable army would be the same group that created the serum.
5. Therefore, ""they"" most likely refers to the scientists.

The men mentioned in the sentence are the objects of the transformation, not the subjects performing the action or having the need. As such, it's unlikely that ""they"" refers to the men.

2. It's more logical that the men who are transformed into super soldiers would be the ones experiencing side effects, rather than the scientists who created the serum.

3. The pronoun ""they"" is closer in proximity to ""men"" than to ""Scientists"" in the sentence, which often indicates the intended reference.

1. The sentence starts with ""The prisoners were held captive by the German forces.""
2. The second part of the sentence provides a reason: ""since they needed to gather intelligence from them.""

The pronoun ""they"" in this context refers to the entity that needs to gather intelligence. Logically, it would be the German forces who are holding the prisoners captive and would need to gather intelligence from them. The prisoners, being captives, are not in a position to gather intelligence.

Therefore, ""they"" refers to ""the German forces"" (candidate 1).",1,1

1. The sentence mentions two people: Captain America and Michael.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""he could not catch him before falling.""
3. This implies that one person was trying to catch the other.
4. Captain America is described as having ""lost a good friend,"" which suggests he was the one trying to do the catching.
5. Michael is implied to be the one who fell, as he is the ""good friend"" that Captain America lost.

Given this analysis, ""he"" most likely refers to Captain America, as he was the one who ""could not catch"" Michael. The pronoun ""he"" is the subject of the action (trying to catch), which aligns with Captain America's role in the sentence.",0,0

The context suggests that President Kennedy had a need or motivation (""he needed the US to beat Russia there""), which aligns with the role of a president making decisions about space missions. Neil Armstrong is mentioned as the person being sent on the mission, but he is not the subject of the action described by ""needed"".

502,Neil Armstrong was actually sent on a secret mission assigned by President Kennedy to investigate an abnormal event so he was trained on what exactly he needed to do.,he,"0: Neil Armstrong, 1: President Kennedy, 2: Neither","In this sentence, there are two instances of the pronoun ""he"". Let's analyze each:

1. ""...so he was trained on what exactly he needed to do.""

This ""he"" clearly refers to Neil Armstrong. The sentence is about Neil Armstrong being sent on a secret mission, and as a result of this assignment, he (Armstrong) was trained for the specific tasks he needed to perform.

2. ""...what exactly he needed to do.""

This second ""he"" also refers to Neil Armstrong. It's a continuation of the same thought, describing what Armstrong was trained for.

Both instances of ""he"" in this sentence refer to Neil Armstrong, not President Kennedy. President Kennedy is mentioned as the one who assigned the mission, but he is not the subject of the training or the one who needed to do something.

1. Subject-verb agreement: ""they"" is used as the subject of the verb ""have,"" which agrees with a plural entity. ""The CIA"" is often treated as a plural entity in American English, referring to the organization as a collective group of people.

2. Logical flow: The sentence is explaining why the CIA controls intelligence gathering. It makes more sense for ""they"" to refer to the CIA having the best people, rather than the United States having the best people.

3. Proximity: ""The CIA"" is the closest noun phrase to the pronoun ""they"" that could logically be its antecedent.

3. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the subordinate clause starting with ""since.""
4. Logically, the entity that ""needs to stay one step ahead of others"" would be the CIA, as it is responsible for intelligence gathering.
5. The United States, as a country, is not directly performing the action of staying ahead; rather, its intelligence agency (the CIA) is doing so on its behalf.

508,Amazon prime encourages Netflix users to switch since they overcharge their users now.,they,"0: Amazon prime, 1: Netflix, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence is comparing Amazon Prime and Netflix.
2. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the clause ""they overcharge their users now.""
3. The sentence structure suggests that Amazon Prime is encouraging Netflix users to switch because of an action performed by the other company.
4. Logically, Amazon Prime would not be encouraging users to switch if they themselves were overcharging.
5. Therefore, ""they"" must refer to Netflix, as it makes more sense in the context that Amazon Prime is criticizing Netflix for overcharging their users.

Based on this analysis, the pronoun ""they"" most likely refers to Netflix.",1,1
509,Dell replaced all their Blackberry phones with their own because they lost confidence in their brand due to to recent network outage.,they,"0: Dell, 1: their Blackberry phones, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" is used twice. Let's analyze each occurrence:

1. ""Dell replaced all their Blackberry phones"": Here, ""their"" refers to Dell, as Dell is the company that owned the Blackberry phones.

2. ""because they lost confidence in their brand"": In this part, ""they"" again refers to Dell. Dell is the subject of the sentence and the entity making the decision to replace the phones. It's Dell who lost confidence in Blackberry's brand.

The pronoun ""they"" consistently refers to Dell throughout the sentence. It cannot refer to ""their Blackberry phones"" because phones are inanimate objects that cannot lose confidence or make decisions. The pronoun is clearly referring to the company Dell, which is making the decisions and actions described in the sentence.",0,0
510,"Dell replaced all their Blackberry phones with their own, but they are still prominent on other vendor sites.",they,"0: Dell, 1: their Blackberry phones, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" is used twice. Let's analyze each occurrence:

1. The first ""they"" in ""Dell replaced all their Blackberry phones"" refers to Dell. This is because Dell is the subject of the sentence and the possessive pronoun ""their"" is used to indicate ownership of the Blackberry phones.

2. The second ""they"" in ""but they are still prominent on other vendor sites"" is the one we need to focus on for this task. This ""they"" refers to ""their Blackberry phones"" because:
   - The sentence is contrasting Dell's action of replacing Blackberry phones with the fact that these phones are still prominent elsewhere.
   - It wouldn't make sense for Dell to be prominent on other vendor sites in this context.
   - The prominence on other vendor sites logically refers to the Blackberry phones that Dell replaced.

Therefore, the pronoun ""they"" in question refers to ""their Blackberry phones,"" which is candidate 1.",1,1
511,Malware has increased over four hundred percent on the Android platform because they are a free platform which allows any developer to post their applications.,they,"0: Malware, 1: the Android platform, 2: Neither","The pronoun ""they"" in this sentence refers to ""the Android platform"". The sentence is explaining why malware has increased on the Android platform, and the reason given is that ""they are a free platform which allows any developer to post their applications"". This characteristic of being a free and open platform clearly applies to Android, not to malware. Therefore, ""they"" is referring to the Android platform.",1,1
512,Malware has increased over four hundred percent on the Android platform since they do not need to get vetted to be uploaded.,they,"0: Malware, 1: the Android platform, 2: Neither","The pronoun ""they"" in this context refers to apps or applications on the Android platform, not to the malware or the Android platform itself. The sentence implies that apps on Android don't need to be vetted before being uploaded, which allows for an increase in malware. Since neither ""Malware"" nor ""the Android platform"" directly corresponds to what ""they"" is referring to, the correct answer is ""Neither.""",0,2
513,Some Motorcycle enthusiasts are selling a TRON lightcycle to TRON fans because they specialize in making movie related vehicles.,they,"0: Some Motorcycle enthusiasts, 1: TRON fans, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. ""Some Motorcycle enthusiasts are selling a TRON lightcycle to TRON fans"" - This is the main clause of the sentence.
2. ""because they specialize in making movie related vehicles"" - This is a subordinate clause explaining why the selling is happening.

The pronoun ""they"" is more likely to refer to the subject of the main clause, which is ""Some Motorcycle enthusiasts."" This makes sense because:

1. The Motorcycle enthusiasts are the ones doing the action (selling).
2. The reason given (specializing in making movie-related vehicles) logically applies to the sellers, not the buyers.
3. It's more plausible that the enthusiasts who make vehicles would specialize in movie-related ones, rather than the TRON fans.

Therefore, ""they"" most likely refers to ""Some Motorcycle enthusiasts.""",0,0
514,"Some Motorcycle enthusiasts are selling a TRON lightcycle to TRON fans, but they may be turned off by the asking price.",they,"0: Some Motorcycle enthusiasts, 1: TRON fans, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. ""Some Motorcycle enthusiasts are selling a TRON lightcycle to TRON fans"" - This establishes two groups: the sellers (Motorcycle enthusiasts) and the potential buyers (TRON fans).

2. ""but they may be turned off by the asking price"" - This part of the sentence introduces the pronoun ""they"" and provides information about their reaction to the price.

The key question is: Who is more likely to be turned off by the asking price?

In this context, it makes more sense for the potential buyers (TRON fans) to be turned off by the price, rather than the sellers (Motorcycle enthusiasts). The sellers are the ones setting the price, so they wouldn't be turned off by their own asking price.

Therefore, ""they"" most likely refers to the TRON fans, who are the potential buyers in this scenario.",1,1
515,The board of directors reviewed the findings of the scientists to determine funding because they are interested in the potential profits for the company.,they,"0: The board of directors, 1: the scientists, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and meaning of the sentence:

1. The sentence is about the board of directors reviewing the findings of the scientists.
2. The purpose of this review is to determine funding.
3. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the clause ""because they are interested in the potential profits for the company.""

Given this information, it's more likely that ""they"" refers to ""The board of directors"" for the following reasons:

1. The board of directors is the main subject of the sentence and the one making the decision about funding.
2. Being interested in potential profits for the company is more aligned with the role and responsibilities of the board of directors rather than the scientists.
3. Scientists are typically more focused on their research findings rather than company profits.

Therefore, the pronoun ""they"" most likely refers to ""The board of directors.""",0,0

1. The sentence has two main parts separated by a comma:
   - ""The board of directors reviewed the findings of the scientists to determine funding""
   - ""so they need to present their findings in a way that can attract more money""

2. The pronoun ""they"" is in the second part of the sentence, which is describing an action that needs to be taken.

3. The action of presenting findings to attract more money logically applies to the scientists, not the board of directors. The scientists are the ones who have findings to present, and they would be the ones trying to attract more funding for their research.

4. The board of directors is reviewing the findings to determine funding, but they are not the ones who need to present findings to attract money.

Therefore, the pronoun ""they"" most likely refers to ""the scientists"" (candidate 1).",1,1

1. ""Some fan girls"" is the subject of the main clause.
2. ""Windows phones"" is part of a prepositional phrase describing what the rap is about.
3. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the subordinate clause ""because they are in love with their new electronics.""

The pronoun ""they"" is more likely to refer to ""Some fan girls"" for the following reasons:
- ""Some fan girls"" is the main subject of the sentence and the most prominent noun phrase.
- It's more logical that fan girls would be ""in love with their new electronics"" rather than Windows phones being in love with electronics.
- The plural pronoun ""they"" agrees grammatically with the plural noun phrase ""Some fan girls.""

Therefore, the pronoun ""they"" most likely refers to ""Some fan girls.""",0,0

The context suggests that despite the fan girls creating a rap about Windows phones, it was the phones themselves that did not become more popular.

519,Some enthusiastic Black Friday shoppers are already lining up at retail stores so they can be the first in line for door busters.,they,"0: Some enthusiastic Black Friday shoppers, 1: retail stores, 2: Neither","The pronoun ""they"" in this sentence refers to ""Some enthusiastic Black Friday shoppers"" for the following reasons:

1. Subject-verb agreement: ""they"" is a plural pronoun, which agrees with the plural subject ""Some enthusiastic Black Friday shoppers.""

2. Logical flow: The sentence describes the actions of the shoppers (lining up) and their intention (to be first in line for door busters). It makes sense that ""they"" refers to the shoppers who are performing these actions.

3. Context: The sentence is about the behavior of Black Friday shoppers, not about the retail stores themselves. The stores are mentioned as the location where the action is taking place, but they are not the main subject of the sentence.

4. Proximity: ""Some enthusiastic Black Friday shoppers"" is the closest noun phrase that agrees in number with the pronoun ""they.""

Therefore, the pronoun ""they"" clearly refers to candidate 0: ""Some enthusiastic Black Friday shoppers.""",0,0

2. ""retail stores"" is part of a prepositional phrase describing where the shoppers are lining up.
3. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the subordinate clause ""because they have some really low priced items that will be on sale.""

Given this analysis, it's clear that ""they"" refers to ""retail stores"" for the following reasons:
- It makes logical sense that retail stores would have low-priced items on sale, not the shoppers.
- The sentence is explaining why shoppers are lining up at the stores, which is because of what the stores are offering.
- Grammatically, ""they"" is more likely to refer to the closer noun phrase ""retail stores"" rather than the more distant ""shoppers.""

521,The campus police pepper sprayed the UC Davis students because they were blocking private property.,they,"0: The campus police, 1: the UC Davis students, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and logic of the sentence:

1. The sentence describes an action taken by the campus police (pepper spraying) against the UC Davis students.
2. The reason for this action is given after the word ""because.""
3. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the clause explaining the reason for the pepper spraying.
4. Logically, the group that would be ""blocking private property"" would be the students, not the police.
5. It wouldn't make sense for the police to pepper spray the students because the police themselves were blocking private property.

Therefore, ""they"" most likely refers to ""the UC Davis students"" as they are the group that was likely blocking private property, which led to the police taking action against them.",1,1

1. The first part of the sentence states that ""The campus police pepper sprayed the UC Davis students.""
2. The second part, introduced by ""so,"" indicates a consequence of this action.
3. The pronoun ""they"" is followed by ""faced an angry backlash.""
4. It's logical that the group facing a backlash would be the one that performed the controversial action (pepper spraying).
5. The phrase ""by those who do not agree with their actions"" further confirms that ""they"" refers to the group that took the action.

Based on this analysis, ""they"" most likely refers to ""The campus police"" because they are the ones who performed the action (pepper spraying) that would logically lead to facing an angry backlash.",0,0
523,"Apple was in talks with Verizon to be their dedicated phone provider initially, but they gave the deal to AT&T in the end.",they,"0: Apple, 1: Verizon, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and grammatical structure of the sentence.

1. The sentence is about a deal between phone companies.
2. Apple was initially in talks with Verizon.
3. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the phrase ""they gave the deal to AT&T.""
4. Logically, the entity giving the deal would be the one who had the power to decide which company to partner with.
5. In this context, Apple would be the company choosing between potential partners (Verizon and AT&T).

Therefore, ""they"" most likely refers to Apple, as Apple would be the entity making the decision to give the deal to AT&T instead of Verizon.",0,0
524,Apple was in talks with Verizon to be their dedicated phone provider initially because they were a prime candidate to provide their service.,they,"0: Apple, 1: Verizon, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" refers to Verizon.

1. The sentence is about parents caring for their children.
2. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the clause ""because they love them undeniably"".
3. The subject of loving in this context is more likely to be the parents, not the children.
4. The object of the love (represented by ""them"") is more likely to be the children.
5. The sentence concludes with ""to want to keep them safe"", which again implies that parents are the subject (the ones wanting to keep the children safe).

Given this analysis, it's clear that ""they"" refers to ""Parents"" in this sentence. Parents are the ones who love their children and want to keep them safe.",0,0
526,Parents care for their children considerably since they are their pride and joy.,they,"0: Parents, 1: their children, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine whether the pronoun ""they"" refers to ""Parents"" or ""their children"". Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""they"" is used to provide additional information about one of the noun phrases.
2. The phrase ""they are their pride and joy"" is more likely to describe children from the perspective of parents, rather than parents describing themselves.
3. It's common for parents to consider their children as a source of pride and joy.
4. Grammatically, ""they"" could refer to either ""Parents"" or ""their children"", but the meaning makes more sense when referring to the children.

528,"Cats are more territorial than dogs, but they can also be territorial at times when marking their territory.",they,"0: Cats, 1: dogs, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" refers to dogs. The sentence structure and context provide clues:

1. The first part of the sentence compares cats and dogs, stating that cats are more territorial.
2. The second part, introduced by ""but,"" shifts the focus to dogs, indicating that despite being less territorial than cats, dogs can still exhibit territorial behavior.
3. The phrase ""they can also be territorial at times"" implies that this is a secondary characteristic, contrasting with the primary subject (cats) mentioned earlier.

Therefore, ""they"" is most likely referring to dogs, as it's introducing additional information about their territorial behavior in contrast to cats.",1,1

5. The pronoun ""they"" is plural, which matches with ""Kung Fu teachers"" (plural) rather than ""their disciples"" (which is referred to as ""them"" in the sentence).

Based on these observations, it's clear that ""they"" refers to the Kung Fu teachers.",0,0

4. The sentence states that the skeleton was scarier because of a certain characteristic.
5. This characteristic is that ""it looked like it was walking.""
6. Logically, a skeleton is more likely to look like it's walking compared to a pumpkin.

1. The sentence compares the skeleton to the pumpkin, stating that the skeleton was scarier.
2. The pronoun ""it"" is used in the clause ""because it was rather simplistic and orange.""
3. The description ""simplistic and orange"" is more likely to refer to a pumpkin than a skeleton.
4. Skeletons are typically not described as orange, while pumpkins are known for their orange color.
5. The simplistic nature could also apply to a typical jack-o'-lantern design on a pumpkin.

2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause that provides the reason for the kicking: ""because he made a condescending comment.""
3. It's more logical that Bob kicked Larry because Larry made a condescending comment, rather than Bob kicking Larry because Bob himself made a condescending comment.
4. The cause-and-effect relationship implies that the person who made the condescending comment (referred to as ""he"") is the one who got kicked, which would be Larry.

Therefore, ""he"" most likely refers to Larry in this context.",1,1
549,"The program deleted the reference to the data, but it did not delete it.",it,"0: The program, 1: the data, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. ""The program deleted the reference to the data"" - This is the first part of the sentence, establishing that the program performed an action on the reference to the data.

2. ""but it did not delete it"" - This is the second part of the sentence, where we need to determine what ""it"" refers to.

3. The first ""it"" in this part is the subject of ""did not delete"". This subject is likely to be the same as the subject of the first part of the sentence, which is ""The program"".

4. The second ""it"" in this part is the object of ""did not delete"". This object is most likely referring to ""the data"" because:
   a) We know the program deleted the reference to the data, but not the data itself.
   b) It wouldn't make sense for the program to delete itself.

Therefore, the pronoun ""it"" in the question most likely refers to ""The program"" (candidate 0), as it is the subject of the action ""did not delete"".",0,0
550,"The program deleted the reference to the data, but it was not deleted.",it,"0: The program, 1: the data, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. ""The program deleted the reference to the data"" - This is the first action in the sentence.
2. ""but it was not deleted"" - This is the second part, connected by ""but,"" which indicates a contrast.

The pronoun ""it"" in the second part refers to something that was not deleted. We need to determine what ""it"" is referring to.

Given the context:
- The program is doing the action (deleting), so it's not likely to be the subject of ""was not deleted.""
- The reference to the data was deleted, but the sentence implies that something was not deleted.
- Logically, ""it"" must refer to ""the data"" itself, not the reference to the data.

Therefore, ""it"" most likely refers to ""the data"" (candidate 1). The sentence is saying that while the program deleted the reference to the data, the actual data itself was not deleted.",1,1
551,"The criminal shocked John, because he pulled out a gun.",he,"0: The criminal, 1: John, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and logic of the sentence:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" refers to the subject who performed an action (pulling out a gun) that shocked John.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used after mentioning both ""The criminal"" and ""John,"" but it's more likely referring to the person who caused the shock.
3. The action of pulling out a gun is more consistent with the behavior of a criminal rather than John, who is described as being shocked.
4. It would be illogical for John to shock himself by pulling out a gun.

Based on these points, it's most reasonable to conclude that ""he"" refers to ""The criminal"" rather than John.",0,0
552,"The criminal shocked John, because he was not expecting it.",he,"0: The criminal, 1: John, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" refers to John, not the criminal.
2. The phrase ""because he was not expecting it"" implies that the person referred to by ""he"" was surprised by the criminal's action.
3. It makes more sense that John would be the one not expecting the criminal's action, rather than the criminal not expecting their own action.
4. The pronoun ""he"" is closer to ""John"" in the sentence, which is often (but not always) an indicator of the pronoun's referent.

Based on these points, it's most logical that ""he"" refers to John in this context.",1,1
553,"A banana and an apple go walking, when the yellow one does the talking.",one,"0: A banana, 1: an apple, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which candidate the pronoun ""one"" refers to. The key information is in the phrase ""the yellow one"". 

1. A banana is typically yellow in color.
2. An apple is usually red, green, or sometimes yellow, but is not primarily associated with being yellow.
3. The sentence mentions ""the yellow one does the talking"", which implies that the ""one"" being referred to is yellow.

Given this information, it's most logical to conclude that ""the yellow one"" refers to the banana. Bananas are characteristically yellow, while apples are not primarily associated with this color.

Therefore, the pronoun ""one"" in this context refers to the banana.",0,0
554,"A banana and an apple go walking, when the red one does the talking.",one,"0: A banana, 1: an apple, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which candidate the pronoun ""one"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. We have two fruits mentioned: a banana and an apple.
2. The pronoun ""one"" is described as ""the red one.""
3. Between bananas and apples, apples are typically red, while bananas are usually yellow.
4. The sentence states that ""the red one does the talking.""

Given this information, we can conclude that ""the red one"" refers to the apple. Apples are commonly red, while bananas are not. Therefore, the pronoun ""one"" in this context is referring to the apple.",1,1
555,"The employer offered Katie a job, because she was a fit for the company.",she,"0: The employer, 1: Katie, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Katie for the following reasons:

1. Katie is the closest preceding noun to the pronoun ""she,"" which is a common pattern in English grammar.
2. The sentence structure suggests that the reason for offering the job (being a fit for the company) is more likely to apply to the job candidate (Katie) rather than the employer.
3. It's more logical for a job candidate to be ""a fit for the company"" rather than the employer themselves.
4. The sentence flows more naturally if ""she"" refers to Katie, as it explains why Katie was offered the job.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Katie (candidate 1).",1,1
556,"The employer offered Katie a job, because she liked the interviewee.",she,"0: The employer, 1: Katie, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. ""The employer offered Katie a job"" - This establishes two people: the employer and Katie.
2. ""because she liked the interviewee"" - This part provides the key information.

The pronoun ""she"" is more likely to refer to the employer for the following reasons:
- The employer is typically the one who makes hiring decisions based on liking an interviewee.
- Katie is referred to as the recipient of the job offer, which implies she was the interviewee.
- It would be unusual for the sentence to state that Katie liked herself as the interviewee.

Therefore, the most logical interpretation is that ""she"" refers to the employer, who liked Katie (the interviewee) and consequently offered her the job.",0,0
557,"Jim was delighted to see Jack, because he brightened up his day.",he,"0: Jim, 1: Jack, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and meaning of the sentence.

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" is the subject of the clause ""he brightened up his day.""
2. The pronoun ""he"" is more likely to refer to Jack because:
   a) Jack is mentioned immediately before the pronoun.
   b) It makes more sense that Jack brightened up Jim's day, as Jim was delighted to see Jack.
3. If ""he"" referred to Jim, the sentence would imply that Jim brightened up his own day by seeing Jack, which is less likely given the sentence structure.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Jack (candidate 1).",1,1
558,"Jim was delighted to see Jack, because he was given the strength to finish his day.",he,"0: Jim, 1: Jack, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" is the subject of the clause following ""because"".
2. The pronoun ""he"" is associated with being ""given the strength to finish his day"".
3. The sentence begins with ""Jim was delighted to see Jack"", which implies that Jim is the main subject of the sentence.
4. It's more logical that Jim would be given strength to finish his day as a result of seeing Jack, rather than Jack being given strength by seeing Jim.

Based on these points, it's more likely that ""he"" refers to Jim. The sentence is describing Jim's reaction to seeing Jack, and how this interaction positively affected Jim's ability to finish his day.",0,0
559,He likes Cuba and hates Japan because it is a communist country.,it,"0: Cuba, 1: Japan, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""it"" refers to Cuba, not Japan. The reasoning is as follows:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""it"" is referring to the country that is communist.
2. Cuba is known to be a communist country, while Japan is not.
3. The sentence states that ""He likes Cuba,"" which is consistent with the positive sentiment towards a communist country.
4. The sentence also states that ""He hates Japan,"" which is contrasted with liking Cuba, further supporting that Cuba is the communist country being referred to.

Therefore, ""it"" in this context refers to Cuba, which is candidate 0.",0,0
560,He likes Cuba and hates Japan because it is not a communist country.,it,"0: Cuba, 1: Japan, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""it"" refers to Japan. The reasoning is as follows:

1. The sentence contrasts two countries: Cuba and Japan.
2. The first part of the sentence states a positive sentiment towards Cuba (""He likes Cuba"").
3. The second part expresses a negative sentiment towards Japan (""hates Japan"").
4. The pronoun ""it"" is used in the explanation for why Japan is hated: ""because it is not a communist country.""
5. This explanation logically applies to Japan, not Cuba, as Cuba is known to be a communist country.

Therefore, ""it"" in this context clearly refers to Japan, which is candidate 1.",1,1
561,Saudi Arabians do not respect the Bangladeshis because they are poor.,they,"0: Saudi Arabians, 1: Bangladeshis, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence presents two groups: Saudi Arabians and Bangladeshis.
2. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the clause ""because they are poor.""
3. Logically, the group being described as ""poor"" is more likely to be the Bangladeshis, not the Saudi Arabians.
4. The sentence structure suggests that the Saudi Arabians are the subject performing the action (not respecting), while the Bangladeshis are the object of that action and the reason for it (being poor).

Given this analysis, it's most logical that ""they"" refers to the Bangladeshis, as they are the group being described as poor in this context.",1,1
562,Saudi Arabians do not respect the Bangladeshis because they are rich.,they,"0: Saudi Arabians, 1: Bangladeshis, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence presents a contrast between two groups: Saudi Arabians and Bangladeshis.
2. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the latter part of the sentence to describe a characteristic.
3. The characteristic mentioned is ""are rich.""

Given this information, we can deduce that ""they"" most likely refers to the Saudi Arabians for the following reasons:
1. It's more common for Saudi Arabia to be associated with wealth due to its oil resources.
2. The sentence structure suggests that the reason for the lack of respect is the wealth of the group referred to by ""they.""
3. It would be illogical for the Bangladeshis to be both disrespected and described as rich in this context.

Therefore, ""they"" most likely refers to the Saudi Arabians.",0,0
563,The city councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit because they feared violence.,they,"0: The city councilmen, 1: The demonstrators, 2: Neither","To determine who ""they"" refers to in this sentence, we need to consider the context and logical flow of the statement.

1. The city councilmen are the main subject of the sentence, performing the action of refusing the permit.
2. The demonstrators are the indirect object, being refused the permit.
3. The pronoun ""they"" is used in conjunction with the verb ""feared,"" indicating that this group is experiencing the fear of violence.

Given the structure of the sentence, it's more logical that the city councilmen would be the ones fearing violence, as this would be their motivation for refusing the permit. The demonstrators are not likely to fear violence from their own demonstration.

Therefore, ""they"" most likely refers to the city councilmen.",0,0
564,The city councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit because they advocated violence.,they,"0: The city councilmen, 1: The demonstrators, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and logic of the sentence:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""they"" is the subject of ""advocated violence.""
2. The city councilmen refused the permit because of some action or characteristic of the demonstrators.
3. Advocating violence would be a logical reason for refusing a permit.
4. It wouldn't make sense for the city councilmen to refuse a permit because they themselves advocated violence.

Given these points, it's most logical that ""they"" refers to the demonstrators. The sentence implies that the demonstrators advocated violence, which led to the city councilmen refusing them a permit.",1,1
565,The trophy doesn't fit into the brown suitcase because it is too large.,it,"0: the trophy, 1: the suitcase, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""it"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence describes a situation where the trophy doesn't fit into the suitcase.
2. The pronoun ""it"" is used in the clause ""because it is too large.""
3. The word ""large"" is more likely to describe the trophy rather than the suitcase in this context.
4. If the suitcase were too large, it wouldn't prevent the trophy from fitting inside.
5. Therefore, the logical conclusion is that the trophy is too large to fit into the suitcase.

Based on this reasoning, the pronoun ""it"" most likely refers to ""the trophy.""",0,0
566,The trophy doesn't fit into the brown suitcase because it is too small.,it,"0: the trophy, 1: the suitcase, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""it"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence logically:

1. The sentence states that ""The trophy doesn't fit into the brown suitcase because it is too small.""
2. The pronoun ""it"" is describing something that is ""too small.""
3. If the trophy were too small, it would fit into the suitcase easily.
4. Therefore, the thing that is ""too small"" must be the suitcase, as it's not large enough to accommodate the trophy.

Based on this reasoning, we can conclude that ""it"" refers to the suitcase.",1,1

569,"Paul tried to call George on the phone, but he wasn't successful.",he,"0: Paul, 1: George, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Paul for the following reasons:

1. Paul is the subject of the main clause and the initiator of the action (trying to call).
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the context of not being successful, which logically relates to the person making the call (Paul) rather than the person being called (George).
3. It's more natural to describe the outcome from the perspective of the person taking the action, which is Paul in this case.

While it's technically possible that ""he"" could refer to George (e.g., if George wasn't successful in answering the phone), the more straightforward and likely interpretation is that ""he"" refers to Paul, who wasn't successful in his attempt to call George.",0,0
570,"Paul tried to call George on the phone, but he wasn't available.",he,"0: Paul, 1: George, 2: Neither","To determine who ""he"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context:

Given this information, it's more likely that ""he"" refers to George rather than Paul. The sentence is conveying that Paul attempted to call George, but George was not available to take the call. It wouldn't make sense for Paul to be unavailable while he's the one making the call.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to George.",1,1
571,"The lawyer asked the witness a question, but he was reluctant to repeat it.",he,"0: the lawyer, 1: the witness, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""he"" refers to: the lawyer or the witness. Let's analyze the context:

1. The lawyer asked the witness a question.
2. ""He"" was reluctant to repeat it.

The pronoun ""he"" is more likely to refer to the witness for the following reasons:

1. The witness is the last mentioned person before the pronoun, making it the most recent subject in the reader's mind.
2. It makes more sense for the witness to be reluctant to repeat something, as witnesses are often hesitant or uncomfortable in legal situations.
3. If the lawyer was reluctant to repeat the question, it would be unusual, as lawyers are typically confident and in control of their questioning.

2. It's more logical that the witness would be reluctant to answer a question, rather than the lawyer being reluctant to answer their own question.

3. The phrase ""reluctant to answer it"" implies that the person referred to by ""he"" is the one being questioned, which would be the witness, not the lawyer.

1. The sentence describes two vehicles: the delivery truck and the school bus.
2. The pronoun ""it"" is used in the clause ""because it was going so fast.""
3. The sentence states that the delivery truck ""zoomed by"" the school bus, which implies high speed.
4. The reason given for the delivery truck zooming by is that ""it was going so fast.""

Based on this analysis, we can conclude that ""it"" refers to the delivery truck. The sentence is explaining why the delivery truck was able to zoom by the school bus, which is because the delivery truck (not the school bus) was going very fast.",0,0

2. It then mentions ""his longtime rival Bill""
3. The pronoun ""he"" appears in the clause ""he was the winner of the competition""

Given this structure, it's more likely that ""he"" refers to Frank rather than Bill for the following reasons:

1. Frank is the subject of the main clause and the sentence is primarily about his feelings.
2. The revelation that ""he was the winner"" is presented as new information that causes Frank to feel vindicated.
3. If ""he"" referred to Bill, it would be strange for Frank to feel vindicated by Bill winning the competition.

Therefore, the most logical interpretation is that Frank is the winner of the competition, which explains why he feels vindicated when his rival Bill reveals this information.",0,0
576,Frank felt crushed when his longtime rival Bill revealed that he was the winner of the competition.,he,"0: Frank, 1: Bill, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence is about Frank and Bill, who are rivals.
2. Bill revealed something about the winner of the competition.
3. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the phrase ""he was the winner of the competition.""

Given this information, it's more likely that ""he"" refers to Bill rather than Frank for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure suggests that Bill is revealing information about someone winning the competition.
2. If Frank had won, it would be odd for Bill to reveal this information, as Frank would already know he had won.
3. The fact that Frank ""felt crushed"" implies that he received bad news, which aligns with finding out that his rival (Bill) had won the competition.

577,The man couldn't lift his son because he was so weak.,he,"0: The man, 1: The son, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence states that ""The man couldn't lift his son.""
2. The reason given is ""because he was so weak.""

In this context, the weakness is the reason for the inability to lift. It's logical to conclude that the person who is weak is the one who couldn't perform the lifting action. Therefore, ""he"" most likely refers to ""The man"" rather than ""The son.""

The man's weakness explains why he couldn't lift his son. If ""he"" referred to the son, it wouldn't make sense in the context of the sentence, as the son's weakness wouldn't prevent the man from lifting him.",0,0

1. The sentence states that ""The man couldn't lift his son.""
2. The reason given is ""because he was so heavy.""

In this context, the pronoun ""he"" is more likely to refer to the son rather than the man. This is because:

1. The inability to lift someone is typically due to the weight of the person being lifted, not the person doing the lifting.
2. If the man was heavy, it wouldn't directly affect his ability to lift his son.
3. The phrase ""so heavy"" implies that the weight is the cause of the difficulty, which logically applies to the son in this scenario.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to the son.",1,1

1. The sentence describes a large ball crashing through a table.
2. The pronoun ""it"" is used in the clause ""because it was made of steel.""
3. The fact that something is made of steel explains why the ball could crash through the table.
4. It's more logical that a ball crashing through a table would be made of steel, rather than the table itself.
5. If the table were made of steel, it would be less likely for the ball to crash through it.

Therefore, ""it"" most likely refers to the large ball, as being made of steel explains its ability to crash through the table.",0,0
580,The large ball crashed right through the table because it was made of styrofoam.,it,"0: The large ball, 1: The table, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""it"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence logically:

1. The sentence describes a large ball crashing through a table.
2. The pronoun ""it"" is used in the clause ""because it was made of styrofoam.""
3. The key question is: Which object is more likely to be made of styrofoam?

Considering the context:
- A large ball could potentially be made of styrofoam, which would explain why it crashed through the table (being large but light).
- Tables are typically not made of styrofoam, as they need to be sturdy to support objects.
- The fact that the ball crashed through the table suggests that the table was not made of styrofoam (as styrofoam would likely break or crumble rather than allow something to crash through it).

Therefore, it is most logical to conclude that ""it"" refers to the large ball, which was made of styrofoam, explaining its ability to crash through the table despite its size.",1,"0

1. The sentence states that John couldn't see the stage because of Billy being in front of him.
2. The reason given is that ""he is so short.""
3. If Billy were short, it wouldn't prevent John from seeing the stage. In fact, it would make it easier for John to see over Billy.
4. Therefore, the logical conclusion is that John is the one who is short, which is why he can't see over Billy.

Based on this reasoning, ""he"" in ""he is so short"" most likely refers to John.",0,0

The pronoun ""he"" is used in the explanation of why John couldn't see the stage. It refers to the person who is tall and blocking John's view. In this case, that person is Billy.

If ""he"" referred to John, the sentence wouldn't make sense because John being tall wouldn't prevent him from seeing the stage. Instead, it's Billy's height that's causing the obstruction.

- The sentence structure suggests that Tom is at a higher position (top of the stairs) compared to Ray.
- It makes more sense for Tom to throw the schoolbag down to Ray after reaching the top of the stairs, rather than Ray throwing the bag up to Tom.
- Tom is mentioned first in the sentence, making him the more prominent subject.

a) The sentence structure suggests that Ray is at the bottom of the stairs, as Tom is throwing the schoolbag down to him.
b) The action of reaching the bottom of the stairs is mentioned after the main action of Tom throwing the bag, implying that it's a separate event performed by a different person (Ray).
c) It would be illogical for Tom to throw his schoolbag down to Ray if Tom himself had already reached the bottom of the stairs.

586,"Although they ran at about the same speed, Sue beat Sally because she had such a bad start.",she,"0: Sue, 1: Sally, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence:

1. ""Although they ran at about the same speed"" - This indicates that Sue and Sally were running at similar speeds.
2. ""Sue beat Sally"" - This tells us that Sue won the race.
3. ""because she had such a bad start"" - This is the key part. The pronoun ""she"" is referring to the person who had a bad start.

Given that Sue beat Sally despite them running at the same speed, it logically follows that Sally must have had the bad start. If Sue had the bad start and still won, it wouldn't make sense to mention it as a reason for her victory.

Therefore, ""she"" in this context refers to Sally, who had the bad start but still ran at about the same speed as Sue, yet lost the race.",1,1
587,The sculpture rolled off the shelf because it wasn't anchored.,it,"0: The sculpture, 1: The shelf, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""it"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence describes an action: ""rolled off the shelf""
2. The subject of this action is ""The sculpture""
3. The pronoun ""it"" is used in the clause ""because it wasn't anchored""
4. Logically, the thing that wasn't anchored is the same as the thing that rolled off the shelf

Based on this analysis, ""it"" most likely refers to ""The sculpture"" because:
- The sculpture is the subject of the main clause
- It makes more sense for a sculpture to be anchored (or not) than for a shelf to be anchored
- The lack of anchoring explains why the sculpture rolled off the shelf

Therefore, the pronoun ""it"" refers to ""The sculpture"" (candidate 0).",0,0
588,The sculpture rolled off the shelf because it wasn't level.,it,"0: The sculpture, 1: The shelf, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""it"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. ""The sculpture rolled off the shelf"" - This part establishes the main action and the two objects involved.
2. ""because it wasn't level"" - This is the reason for the action.

The pronoun ""it"" in this context is more likely to refer to ""the shelf"" for the following reasons:
1. The sentence is explaining why the sculpture rolled off, which implies that something was wrong with the surface it was on (the shelf).
2. It's more logical for a shelf to be ""not level"" than for a sculpture to be ""not level"" in this context.
3. If the sculpture wasn't level, it wouldn't necessarily cause it to roll off the shelf.

Therefore, ""it"" most likely refers to ""the shelf"" as the thing that wasn't level, causing the sculpture to roll off.",1,1
589,Sam's drawing was hung just above Tina's and it did look much better with another one below it.,it,"0: Sam's drawing, 1: Tina's drawing, 2: Neither","Let's analyze the sentence step by step:

1. ""Sam's drawing was hung just above Tina's"" - This establishes the position of the two drawings relative to each other.

2. ""and it did look much better with another one below it"" - Here, we need to determine what ""it"" refers to.

3. The pronoun ""it"" is singular, so it must refer to one of the drawings, not both.

4. The key phrase is ""with another one below it"". This implies that ""it"" refers to the drawing that has another one below it.

5. We know from the first part of the sentence that Sam's drawing is above Tina's.

Therefore, ""it"" must refer to Sam's drawing, as Sam's drawing is the one that has another drawing (Tina's) below it.",0,0
590,Sam's drawing was hung just above Tina's and it did look much better with another one above it.,it,"0: Sam's drawing, 1: Tina's drawing, 2: Neither","Let's analyze the sentence step by step:

1. ""Sam's drawing was hung just above Tina's"" - This establishes the position of the two drawings, with Sam's above Tina's.

2. ""and it did look much better with another one above it"" - Here, we need to determine what ""it"" refers to.

3. The pronoun ""it"" is singular, so it must refer to a single drawing.

4. The phrase ""with another one above it"" suggests that ""it"" refers to the drawing that already has something above it.

5. Since Sam's drawing is already above Tina's, the only drawing that could have ""another one above it"" is Tina's drawing.

Therefore, the pronoun ""it"" most likely refers to Tina's drawing.",1,1
591,Anna did a lot better than her good friend Lucy on the test because she had studied so hard.,she,"0: Anna, 1: Lucy, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence compares Anna's performance to Lucy's on a test.
2. It states that Anna did ""a lot better"" than Lucy.
3. The reason given for this better performance is that ""she had studied so hard.""

Given this information, it's logical to conclude that ""she"" refers to Anna for the following reasons:
- The sentence is explaining why Anna performed better than Lucy.
- Studying hard is typically associated with better test performance.
- It would be inconsistent to say that Lucy studied hard but performed worse than Anna.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Anna.",0,0
592,Anna did a lot worse than her good friend Lucy on the test because she had studied so hard.,she,"0: Anna, 1: Lucy, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""because she had studied so hard.""
2. This clause is explaining why one person did worse than the other on the test.
3. Logically, studying hard should lead to better performance, not worse.
4. The sentence states that ""Anna did a lot worse than her good friend Lucy.""
5. Therefore, it would not make sense for ""she"" to refer to Anna, as Anna did worse despite the implication of hard study.
6. It's more logical that ""she"" refers to Lucy, who presumably did better on the test because she had studied hard.

Based on this reasoning, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Lucy.",1,1
593,The firemen arrived after the police because they were coming from so far away.,they,"0: The firemen, 1: The police, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence mentions two groups: the firemen and the police.
2. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the clause ""because they were coming from so far away.""
3. This clause explains why one group arrived after the other.
4. The sentence states that ""The firemen arrived after the police.""
5. The reason given for arriving later is that ""they were coming from so far away.""

Based on this analysis, we can conclude that ""they"" refers to the firemen. The firemen arrived after the police because the firemen (they) were coming from far away. This explanation justifies why the firemen arrived later than the police.",0,0
594,The firemen arrived before the police because they were coming from so far away.,they,"0: The firemen, 1: The police, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence mentions two groups: the firemen and the police.
2. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the clause ""because they were coming from so far away.""
3. This clause explains why one group arrived before the other.
4. The sentence states that ""The firemen arrived before the police.""
5. The reason given for this is that ""they were coming from so far away.""

Logically, if the firemen arrived first, they cannot be the ones coming from far away. If they were coming from far away, they would likely arrive later. Therefore, ""they"" must refer to the police, who arrived after the firemen because they (the police) were coming from so far away.",1,1
595,Frank was upset with Tom because the toaster he had bought from him didn't work.,he,"0: Frank, 1: Tom, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions two people: Frank and Tom.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""the toaster he had bought from him.""
3. The sentence structure suggests that Frank was upset with Tom because of a toaster.
4. The pronoun ""he"" is the subject of ""had bought,"" indicating the buyer of the toaster.
5. The phrase ""from him"" implies that Tom was the seller of the toaster.

Given this analysis, it's clear that Frank is the one who bought the toaster from Tom. Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" in this context refers to Frank.",0,0
596,Frank was upset with Tom because the toaster he had sold him didn't work.,he,"0: Frank, 1: Tom, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions two people: Frank and Tom.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""he had sold him.""
3. The sentence indicates that Frank was upset with Tom because of a faulty toaster.
4. The logical interpretation is that Tom sold the toaster to Frank.

Therefore, ""he"" in this context refers to Tom, as he is the one who sold the toaster to Frank.",1,1
597,Jim yelled at Kevin because he was so upset.,he,"0: Jim, 1: Kevin, 2: Neither","To determine who ""he"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and the most logical interpretation:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" refers to the subject of the reason for yelling, which comes after ""because.""
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used to explain why Jim yelled at Kevin.
3. It's more likely that Jim yelled at Kevin because Jim himself was upset, rather than Kevin being upset (which wouldn't typically cause Jim to yell at him).
4. The use of ""so"" emphasizes the intensity of the emotion, which aligns better with the person doing the yelling (Jim).

Given these points, it's most logical to conclude that ""he"" refers to Jim. Jim was so upset that he yelled at Kevin.",0,0
598,Jim comforted Kevin because he was so upset.,he,"0: Jim, 1: Kevin, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence structure is: [Subject] [verb] [Object] because [pronoun] was [adjective].
2. Jim is the subject performing the action of comforting.
3. Kevin is the object receiving the comfort.
4. The pronoun ""he"" is followed by ""was so upset.""

Given this structure, it's more logical that Kevin was the one who was upset, which is why Jim comforted him. If Jim was upset, it wouldn't make sense for him to be comforting Kevin.

Therefore, ""he"" most likely refers to Kevin (candidate 1).",1,1
599,"The sack of potatoes had been placed above the bag of flour, so it had to be moved first.",it,"0: The sack of potatoes, 1: The bag of flour, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""it"" refers to ""The sack of potatoes"" for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure indicates that ""it"" is the subject of the clause ""it had to be moved first.""
2. The context suggests that the item that needs to be moved first is the one placed above, which is explicitly stated to be the sack of potatoes.
3. The sentence begins by mentioning the sack of potatoes, making it the primary subject and the most likely antecedent for the pronoun ""it.""

Therefore, the pronoun ""it"" clearly refers to ""The sack of potatoes"" and not ""The bag of flour"" or any other entity.",0,0
600,"The sack of potatoes had been placed below the bag of flour, so it had to be moved first.",it,"0: The sack of potatoes, 1: The bag of flour, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""it"" refers to, let's analyze the sentence:

""The sack of potatoes had been placed below the bag of flour, so it had to be moved first.""

The pronoun ""it"" in this sentence refers to the object that needs to be moved first. The sentence states that the sack of potatoes was placed below the bag of flour, and then mentions that ""it"" had to be moved first. Logically, if something is below another object and needs to be moved first, it would be the bottom object.

Therefore, ""it"" refers to ""the sack of potatoes"" because:
1. The sack of potatoes is mentioned as being below the bag of flour.
2. The sentence implies that the bottom object needs to be moved first.
3. ""It"" is used to refer to the object that needs to be moved first.",1,0
601,Pete envies Martin although he is very successful.,he,"0: Pete, 1: Martin, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Pete envies Martin,"" establishing Pete as the subject and Martin as the object.
2. The pronoun ""he"" appears in the clause ""although he is very successful.""
3. The use of ""although"" indicates a contrast between the main clause and the subordinate clause.
4. The fact that Pete envies Martin suggests that Martin is the one who is successful, as people typically envy those who have qualities or achievements they desire.
5. It would be illogical for Pete to envy Martin if Pete himself was very successful.

Based on this analysis, it is most likely that ""he"" refers to Martin, as Martin's success is the reason for Pete's envy.",0,1
602,Pete envies Martin because he is very successful.,he,"0: Pete, 1: Martin, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" refers to the reason why Pete envies Martin.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is associated with being ""very successful.""
3. Logically, Pete would envy Martin because Martin is very successful, not because Pete himself is very successful.
4. Therefore, ""he"" most likely refers to Martin, as Martin's success is the cause of Pete's envy.

Based on this reasoning, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Martin.",1,1
603,"The older students were bullying the younger ones, so we punished them.",them,"0: The older students, 1: The younger students, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""them"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and logical flow of the sentence:

1. The sentence describes two groups: ""the older students"" and ""the younger ones.""
2. The first part of the sentence states that the older students were bullying the younger ones.
3. The second part of the sentence says ""so we punished them.""

Given this information, we can deduce that:
- The pronoun ""them"" is likely referring to the group that was doing the bullying and deserved punishment.
- The older students were the ones doing the bullying.
- It makes logical sense that the punishment would be directed at the bullies, not the victims.

Therefore, ""them"" most likely refers to ""the older students"" who were bullying the younger ones.",0,0
604,"The older students were bullying the younger ones, so we rescued them.",them,"0: The older students, 1: The younger students, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""them"" refers to ""the younger ones"" for the following reasons:

1. Context: The sentence describes a situation where older students are bullying younger ones.
2. Action: The sentence states ""we rescued them,"" implying that someone intervened to help.
3. Logical inference: It makes more sense that the rescue would be for the victims (the younger ones) rather than the bullies (the older students).
4. Grammatical agreement: ""Them"" is plural, which agrees with ""the younger ones"" (also plural).

Therefore, the pronoun ""them"" most likely refers to ""the younger ones,"" which corresponds to candidate 1.",1,1
605,I poured water from the bottle into the cup until it was empty.,it,"0: the bottle, 1: the cup, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""it"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The action described is pouring water from a bottle into a cup.
2. The pronoun ""it"" is used in the phrase ""until it was empty.""

In this context, ""it"" most likely refers to ""the bottle"" because:

1. The bottle is the source of the water being poured.
2. The action of pouring continues until something is empty.
3. It makes more sense for the bottle to become empty as a result of pouring, rather than the cup.

The cup, on the other hand, would be filling up during this action, not becoming empty.

Therefore, the pronoun ""it"" most likely refers to ""the bottle.""",0,0
606,I poured water from the bottle into the cup until it was full.,it,"0: the bottle, 1: the cup, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""it"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The action described is pouring water from a bottle into a cup.
2. The pronoun ""it"" is used in the phrase ""until it was full.""

In this context, ""it"" most likely refers to ""the cup"" because:
1. The cup is the recipient of the water being poured.
2. It makes more sense for a cup to be filled to fullness rather than a bottle.
3. The bottle is the source of the water, and it's unlikely to be filled in this scenario.

607,Susan knows all about Ann's personal problems because she is nosy.,she,"0: Susan, 1: Ann, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence is about Susan knowing Ann's personal problems.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""because she is nosy.""
3. Being nosy is the reason given for knowing someone else's personal problems.
4. It makes more logical sense for the person who knows about someone else's problems to be described as nosy, rather than the person whose problems are known.

Given this reasoning, ""she"" most likely refers to Susan, as Susan is the one who knows about Ann's problems, and being nosy explains why she has this knowledge.",0,0
608,Susan knows all about Ann's personal problems because she is indiscreet.,she,"0: Susan, 1: Ann, 2: Neither","To determine who ""she"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and meaning:

1. The sentence states that ""Susan knows all about Ann's personal problems.""
2. The reason given for this knowledge is that ""she is indiscreet.""

Being indiscreet means not keeping information private or secret. In this context, it makes more sense that Ann is the one who is indiscreet, rather than Susan. If Ann is indiscreet about her own personal problems, it would explain why Susan knows about them.

If Susan were the indiscreet one, it wouldn't explain how she came to know Ann's personal problems in the first place. It would only suggest that Susan might tell others about Ann's problems, which is not the focus of this sentence.

Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Ann in this context.",1,1
609,Sid explained his theory to Mark but he couldn't convince him.,he,"0: Sid, 1: Mark, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Sid is explaining his theory to Mark.
2. Someone (referred to as ""he"") couldn't convince someone else (referred to as ""him"").

Given the structure of the sentence, it's more likely that ""he"" refers to Sid for the following reasons:
- Sid is the subject of the first clause and the main actor (explaining the theory).
- It's natural for the person explaining a theory to try to convince the listener.
- The pronoun ""him"" at the end likely refers to Mark, as he's the one being explained to.

Therefore, the most logical interpretation is that Sid (he) couldn't convince Mark (him).",0,0
610,Sid explained his theory to Mark but he couldn't understand him.,he,"0: Sid, 1: Mark, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. ""Sid explained his theory to Mark"" - This establishes that Sid is explaining something to Mark.

2. ""but he couldn't understand him"" - This is the key part where we need to determine who ""he"" refers to.

3. The pronoun ""he"" is more likely to refer to Mark in this context because:
   - It's more logical that Mark couldn't understand Sid's explanation, rather than Sid not understanding his own theory.
   - The sentence structure suggests a contrast (""but"") between Sid explaining and someone not understanding, implying it's Mark who didn't understand.
   - It's common in English for a pronoun to refer to the most recently mentioned person when there's ambiguity, which in this case is Mark.

4. The ""him"" at the end of the sentence likely refers back to Sid, further supporting that ""he"" refers to Mark.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Mark in this sentence.",1,1
611,"Susan knew that Ann's son had been in a car accident, so she told her about it.",she,"0: Susan, 1: Ann, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Susan knew about Ann's son's car accident.
2. ""She"" told ""her"" about it.

The pronoun ""she"" is more likely to refer to Susan because:
- Susan is the subject of the first clause and has the knowledge about the accident.
- It would make more sense for Susan to tell Ann about the accident, rather than Ann telling Susan (since Susan already knew about it).
- The use of ""her"" later in the sentence suggests that Ann is being told about the accident, making Susan the one doing the telling.

Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Susan.",0,0
612,"Susan knew that Ann's son had been in a car accident, because she told her about it.",she,"0: Susan, 1: Ann, 2: Neither","To determine who ""she"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and logical flow of information:

1. The sentence states that Susan knew about Ann's son's car accident.
2. The reason for Susan's knowledge is given after ""because"": ""she told her about it.""
3. For this to make sense, ""she"" must refer to the person who had the information and shared it with the other person.
4. Since Susan is the one who ""knew"" about the accident, it's logical that Ann (the mother of the son involved in the accident) would be the one to tell Susan about it.
5. Therefore, ""she"" in this context most likely refers to Ann, as she would be the primary source of information about her son's accident.",1,1
613,"Joe's uncle can still beat him at tennis, even though he is 30 years younger.",he,"0: Joe, 1: Joe's uncle, 2: Neither","To determine who the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and logic of the sentence:

1. The sentence compares two people: Joe and Joe's uncle.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""even though he is 30 years younger.""
3. The sentence implies that despite this age difference, Joe's uncle can still beat Joe at tennis.
4. It's more logical that Joe would be the younger person in this scenario, as uncles are typically older than their nephews.

Therefore, ""he"" most likely refers to Joe, who is 30 years younger than his uncle.",0,0
614,"Joe's uncle can still beat him at tennis, even though he is 30 years older.",he,"0: Joe, 1: Joe's uncle, 2: Neither","To determine who the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence is about Joe and Joe's uncle playing tennis.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""even though he is 30 years older.""
3. The phrase ""30 years older"" suggests that we're comparing the ages of two people.
4. It's more likely that an uncle would be older than his nephew (Joe).

Given this information, it's logical to conclude that ""he"" refers to Joe's uncle, who is 30 years older than Joe but can still beat him at tennis. The age difference is more naturally described from the perspective of the younger person (Joe) to the older person (Joe's uncle).",1,1
615,The painting in Mark's living room shows an oak tree. It is to the right of the bookcase.,It,"0: The painting, 1: The oak tree, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""It"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and sentence structure:

1. The first sentence introduces two elements: ""The painting"" and ""an oak tree"".
2. The second sentence starts with ""It"", which is likely referring to one of these elements.
3. The second sentence states that ""It is to the right of the bookcase"".

Given this information, we can deduce that ""It"" most likely refers to ""The painting"" for the following reasons:
- The painting is the main subject of the first sentence, making it a more prominent antecedent.
- It's more logical for a painting to be positioned relative to a bookcase in a living room, rather than an oak tree (which is likely the subject of the painting, not a physical tree in the room).
- The oak tree is mentioned as part of the painting's description, not as a separate object in the room.

Therefore, the pronoun ""It"" most likely refers to ""The painting"".",0,0
616,The painting in Mark's living room shows an oak tree. It is to the right of a house.,It,"0: The painting, 1: The oak tree, 2: Neither","Let's analyze the sentence structure and context to determine what ""It"" refers to:

1. The first sentence introduces two objects: the painting and the oak tree.
2. The second sentence starts with ""It,"" which is referring to one of these objects.
3. The sentence states that ""It is to the right of a house.""

Given this information, we need to consider which of these objects would more likely be positioned relative to a house:

- The painting is described as being in Mark's living room, so it's unlikely that its position would be described relative to a house.
- The oak tree, being an outdoor object, is more likely to be described in relation to a house.

Therefore, ""It"" most likely refers to the oak tree, not the painting.",1,1
617,There is a gap in the wall. You can see the garden through it.,it,"0: The gap, 1: The wall, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence by sentence:

1. ""There is a gap in the wall."" - This introduces two potential referents: the gap and the wall.
2. ""You can see the garden through it."" - Here, ""it"" is used as a pronoun.

The pronoun ""it"" in this context refers to something that you can see through to view the garden. Logically, you would see through a gap, not through a solid wall. The gap is the opening that allows visibility to the garden.

Therefore, ""it"" most likely refers to ""the gap"" rather than ""the wall"".",0,0
618,There is a gap in the wall. You can see the garden behind it.,it,"0: The gap, 1: The wall, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""it"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and grammatical structure of the sentences:

1. The first sentence introduces two nouns: ""gap"" and ""wall"".
2. The second sentence uses the pronoun ""it"" in the phrase ""behind it"".
3. Logically, you can see the garden behind the wall, not behind the gap.
4. The wall is a solid object that can obstruct the view of the garden, while a gap is an opening.
5. It makes more sense to say ""behind the wall"" than ""behind the gap"".

1. The main subject of the first sentence is ""The drain.""
2. The second sentence, ""It has to be cleaned,"" logically follows as an action that needs to be taken regarding the drain.
3. While the hair is mentioned, it's described as the cause of the clog, not the thing that needs to be cleaned.
4. Grammatically, ""The drain"" is singular and matches with the singular pronoun ""It.""
5. Contextually, it makes more sense to clean a drain rather than cleaning hair that's already clogging the drain.

Therefore, the pronoun ""It"" in the second sentence is most likely referring to ""The drain.""",0,0
620,The drain is clogged with hair. It has to be removed.,It,"0: The drain, 1: The hair, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""It"" most likely refers to ""the hair"" rather than ""the drain"" for the following reasons:

1. Context: The sentence is discussing a clogged drain, and the problem is the hair causing the clog.
2. Logical action: It makes more sense to remove the hair that's causing the clog rather than removing the entire drain.
3. Grammar: ""It"" is singular, which matches both ""the drain"" and ""the hair,"" but the action of removal is more applicable to the hair.

Therefore, the pronoun ""It"" in the sentence ""It has to be removed"" is most likely referring to the hair that's clogging the drain.",1,1

1. ""Luckily, it was short"": This ""it"" clearly refers to the meeting. The sentence is expressing that fortunately, the meeting didn't take long, which allowed the speaker to catch their train.

2. ""so it worked out"": This ""it"" refers to the entire situation - the fact that the meeting was short and the speaker was able to make it to their train. This usage of ""it"" doesn't specifically refer to either the meeting or the train, but rather the overall scenario.

Since the question asks which candidate the pronoun refers to, and the first and more specific use of ""it"" clearly refers to the meeting, the correct answer is 0: The meeting.",0,0

Luckily, it was delayed, so it worked out.",it,"0: The meeting, 1: The train, 2: Neither","In this context, the pronoun ""it"" most likely refers to the train. The sentence ""Luckily, it was delayed, so it worked out"" suggests that something being delayed was beneficial to the speaker. Given the time constraints mentioned (meeting at 4:00 and needing to catch the train at 4:30), it makes more sense that the train being delayed would be lucky and work out for the speaker. If the meeting had been delayed, it would have made catching the train even more difficult. Therefore, ""it"" refers to the train.",1,1

The sentence structure indicates that the pillar is the obstacle preventing the speaker from seeing the stage. The phrase ""I can't see around it"" directly relates to the pillar, as it's the object that's blocking the view. The stage is mentioned as the thing the speaker is trying to see, but it's not what ""it"" refers to in this context.",0,0
624,"There is a pillar between me and the stage, and I can't see it.",it,"0: The pillar, 1: The stage, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""it"" most likely refers to ""the stage"" for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure suggests that the pillar is obstructing the view of something.
2. The phrase ""I can't see it"" implies that there's an object of interest that the speaker wants to see but can't.
3. In this context, the stage is typically the focal point of attention, not the pillar.
4. It's more logical that someone would be frustrated about not being able to see the stage rather than not being able to see the pillar that's blocking their view.

Therefore, ""it"" in this sentence is most likely referring to ""the stage.""",1,1
625,"They broadcast an announcement, but a subway came into the station and I couldn't hear it.",it,"0: The announcement, 1: The subway, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""it"" most likely refers to ""the announcement"" for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""it"" is the object that the speaker couldn't hear.
2. The context implies that the announcement was something meant to be heard, but was interrupted by the noise of the subway.
3. It's more logical that the speaker couldn't hear the announcement due to the subway noise, rather than not being able to hear the subway itself.
4. The pronoun ""it"" is singular, which matches with ""the announcement"" (singular) rather than ""a subway"" (which would typically be referred to as ""it"" only if it had been the main subject of the previous clause).

Therefore, the most appropriate referent for ""it"" is ""the announcement.""",0,0
626,"They broadcast an announcement, but a subway came into the station and I couldn't hear over it.",it,"0: The announcement, 1: The subway, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""it"" refers to the subway. The context suggests that the speaker couldn't hear the announcement because of the noise from the subway entering the station. The pronoun ""it"" is used at the end of the sentence to refer back to the subway, which is the cause of the speaker's inability to hear the announcement.

The sentence structure indicates that ""it"" is the object that prevented the speaker from hearing, which logically points to the subway rather than the announcement. The announcement is something the speaker was trying to hear, while the subway is the obstacle to hearing.",1,1
627,"In the middle of the outdoor concert, the rain started falling, but it continued until 10.",it,"0: The concert, 1: The rain, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""it"" refers to ""the rain"" for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""it"" is the subject of the second clause, which is connected to the first clause by ""but"".

2. The verb ""continued"" is more logically associated with rain than with a concert. Rain can continue falling, while a concert doesn't typically ""continue"" in the same sense.

3. The timeframe ""until 10"" also aligns more naturally with the duration of rainfall rather than the duration of a concert.

4. The concert is mentioned as the setting or context, but the main action of the sentence revolves around the rain starting and then continuing.

Therefore, the most logical referent for ""it"" in this sentence is ""the rain"".",0,1
628,"In the middle of the outdoor concert, the rain started falling, and it continued until 10.",it,"0: The concert, 1: The rain, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""it"" clearly refers to ""the rain"" for the following reasons:

1. The sentence introduces two main elements: the outdoor concert and the rain.
2. The pronoun ""it"" is used in the context of something that ""continued until 10.""
3. It's more logical and natural for rain to continue until a specific time, rather than a concert (especially an outdoor one during rain).
4. The structure of the sentence suggests that ""it"" is referring to the most recently mentioned noun, which is ""the rain.""

Therefore, the pronoun ""it"" is referring to ""the rain"" (candidate 1) in this context.",1,1
629,"I used an old rag to clean the knife, and then I put it in the trash.",it,"0: The rag, 1: The knife, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""it"" refers to, let's analyze the sentence:

""I used an old rag to clean the knife, and then I put it in the trash.""

The pronoun ""it"" is used in the second part of the sentence: ""I put it in the trash."" We need to consider which object is more likely to be put in the trash after cleaning.

1. The rag: It's common to throw away old rags after using them for cleaning, especially if they're very dirty or worn out.
2. The knife: Knives are typically not thrown away after being cleaned; they are usually kept for future use.

Given this context, it's more logical that ""it"" refers to the rag rather than the knife. It makes more sense to put a used cleaning rag in the trash than to discard a knife after cleaning it.",0,0
630,"I used an old rag to clean the knife, and then I put it in the drawer.",it,"0: The rag, 1: The knife, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""it"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence describes two actions: cleaning the knife with a rag, and then putting something in the drawer.
2. The pronoun ""it"" is used in the second action, referring to the object being put in the drawer.
3. Logically, it makes more sense to put a knife in a drawer rather than a rag.
4. The knife is also the last mentioned object before the pronoun, making it the more likely referent.

Based on these observations, it is more probable that ""it"" refers to the knife rather than the rag.",1,1
631,"Ann asked Mary what time the library closes, because she had forgotten.",she,"0: Ann, 1: Mary, 2: Neither","To determine who ""she"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and logical flow of the information provided.

1. Ann asked Mary about the library closing time.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""because she had forgotten.""

The most logical interpretation is that Ann is the one who had forgotten the library closing time. This makes sense because:

1. Ann is the one asking about the closing time, which suggests she doesn't know it.
2. If Mary had forgotten, she wouldn't be the one being asked; she would be the one asking.

Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Ann in this context.",0,0
632,"Ann asked Mary what time the library closes, but she had forgotten.",she,"0: Ann, 1: Mary, 2: Neither","To determine who ""she"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and the most logical interpretation.

The sentence states that ""Ann asked Mary what time the library closes, but she had forgotten."" The pronoun ""she"" is used in the second part of the sentence, referring to someone who had forgotten something.

There are two possible interpretations:

1. Ann had forgotten the library's closing time, which is why she asked Mary.
2. Mary had forgotten the library's closing time, so she couldn't answer Ann's question.

Both interpretations are plausible, but the first one seems more likely. If Mary had forgotten, it would be more natural to phrase it as ""but Mary didn't know"" or ""but Mary couldn't remember."" The use of ""she had forgotten"" implies that we're referring back to the subject of the main clause, which is Ann.

Therefore, it's more probable that ""she"" refers to Ann in this context.",1,0
633,I took the water bottle out of the backpack so that it would be handy.,it,"0: The water bottle, 1: The backpack, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""it"" most likely refers to ""the water bottle"" for the following reasons:

1. The action of taking the water bottle out of the backpack is performed with the purpose of making something ""handy.""
2. It's more logical that the water bottle would be made handy by taking it out of the backpack, rather than the backpack itself being made handy.
3. The pronoun ""it"" is singular, which matches with ""the water bottle"" (singular) rather than ""the backpack"" (also singular, but less likely in this context).
4. The sentence structure suggests that the object being made handy is the same object that was taken out, which is the water bottle.

Therefore, the pronoun ""it"" most likely refers to ""the water bottle"" (candidate 0).",0,0
634,I took the water bottle out of the backpack so that it would be lighter.,it,"0: The water bottle, 1: The backpack, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""it"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence describes two objects: the water bottle and the backpack.
2. The action is taking the water bottle out of the backpack.
3. The purpose of this action is stated after ""so that"": to make something lighter.

The pronoun ""it"" is used in the clause ""so that it would be lighter."" We need to consider which object would become lighter as a result of removing the water bottle:

- The water bottle itself wouldn't become lighter by being removed from the backpack.
- The backpack, however, would become lighter after the water bottle is removed from it.

Therefore, the pronoun ""it"" logically refers to the backpack, as it is the object that would become lighter as a result of the action described in the sentence.",1,1
635,I couldn't put the pot on the shelf because it was too tall.,it,"0: The pot, 1: The shelf, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""it"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence logically:

1. The sentence states that something couldn't be put on the shelf because of height.
2. The pronoun ""it"" is described as ""too tall.""
3. Between a pot and a shelf, a shelf is typically fixed in place and its height doesn't usually prevent items from being placed on it.
4. It's more logical that a pot could be too tall to fit on a shelf.

Therefore, ""it"" most likely refers to the pot, as the pot being too tall would prevent it from being placed on the shelf.",0,0
636,I couldn't put the pot on the shelf because it was too high.,it,"0: The pot, 1: The shelf, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""it"" refers to ""the shelf"" rather than ""the pot"". The reasoning is as follows:

1. The sentence states that something was ""too high"", which prevented the action of putting the pot on the shelf.
2. Logically, it makes more sense for the shelf to be too high rather than the pot. If the pot were too high, it wouldn't prevent placing it on the shelf.
3. The structure of the sentence suggests that ""it"" refers to the last mentioned noun, which is ""the shelf"".

Therefore, the pronoun ""it"" most likely refers to ""the shelf"" (candidate 1).",1,1
637,I'm sure that my map will show this building; it is very good.,it,"0: The map, 1: The building, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""it"" most likely refers to ""my map"" rather than ""this building"". The reasoning is as follows:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""it"" is the subject of the second clause, which is describing a quality (""very good"").
2. It's more logical for a map to be described as ""very good"" rather than a building in this context.
3. The first part of the sentence expresses confidence in the map's ability to show the building, which sets up the map as the main subject of discussion.
4. The use of ""it"" immediately follows the statement about the map, creating a natural flow of reference.

Therefore, ""it"" most likely refers to ""The map"" (candidate 0).",0,0
638,I'm sure that my map will show this building; it is very famous.,it,"0: The map, 1: The building, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""it"" refers to ""this building"" rather than ""my map"". The reasoning is as follows:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""it"" is the subject of the second clause, which is describing something as ""very famous"".
2. It's more logical and common for a building to be described as ""very famous"" rather than a map.
3. The phrase ""this building"" immediately precedes the pronoun ""it"", making it the most recent and relevant noun for the pronoun to refer to.
4. The context implies that the speaker is confident about finding a specific building on their map, and then provides additional information about that building (its fame), rather than describing the map itself.

Therefore, the pronoun ""it"" most likely refers to ""the building"" (candidate 1).",1,1
639,Bob paid for Charlie's college education. He is very generous.,He,"0: Bob, 1: Charlie, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""He"" most likely refers to Bob for the following reasons:

1. Bob is the subject of the first sentence and performs the action of paying for Charlie's college education.
2. The second sentence describes the subject as ""very generous,"" which aligns with the action of paying for someone else's education.
3. It's more logical to describe the person who paid for the education as generous, rather than the recipient of the education.

Therefore, ""He"" in the second sentence is most likely referring to Bob, who demonstrated generosity by paying for Charlie's college education.",0,0
640,Bob paid for Charlie's college education. He is very grateful.,He,"0: Bob, 1: Charlie, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""He"" most likely refers to Charlie. The context suggests that Bob paid for Charlie's college education, and as a result, someone is very grateful. It's more logical and common for the person receiving the benefit (in this case, Charlie getting his education paid for) to be grateful, rather than the person providing the benefit (Bob). Therefore, ""He"" in ""He is very grateful"" is more likely to refer to Charlie.",1,1
641,"Bob paid for Charlie's college education, but now Charlie acts as though it never happened. He is very hurt.",He,"0: Bob, 1: Charlie, 2: Neither","To determine who ""He"" refers to in this context, we need to analyze the sentence structure and the emotional implications:

1. The first sentence describes Bob's action (paying for Charlie's education) and Charlie's reaction (acting as though it never happened).

2. The second sentence, ""He is very hurt,"" introduces an emotional state.

3. Given the context, it's more logical that Bob would be hurt by Charlie's behavior, rather than Charlie being hurt by his own actions.

4. The pronoun ""He"" is more likely to refer to Bob because:
   a) Bob is the one who did something generous (paying for Charlie's education).
   b) Charlie's ungrateful behavior would naturally cause hurt feelings in Bob.

Therefore, the pronoun ""He"" most likely refers to Bob in this context.",0,0
642,"Bob paid for Charlie's college education, but now Charlie acts as though it never happened. He is very ungrateful.",He,"0: Bob, 1: Charlie, 2: Neither","In this context, the pronoun ""He"" most likely refers to Charlie for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure suggests a contrast between Bob's actions and Charlie's behavior.
2. The phrase ""acts as though it never happened"" implies that Charlie is the one behaving in an ungrateful manner.
3. The final statement ""He is very ungrateful"" logically follows from Charlie's described behavior, not Bob's generous action.

It wouldn't make sense for ""He"" to refer to Bob, as Bob is portrayed as the generous one who paid for Charlie's education. The ungrateful behavior is attributed to the recipient of this generosity, which is Charlie.",1,1
643,"Bob was playing cards with Adam and was way ahead. If Adam hadn't had a sudden run of good luck, he would have won.",he,"0: Bob, 1: Adam, 2: Neither","Let's analyze the sentence to determine who ""he"" refers to:

1. The first part of the sentence states that ""Bob was playing cards with Adam and was way ahead.""
2. The second part mentions ""If Adam hadn't had a sudden run of good luck, he would have won.""

The pronoun ""he"" in this context refers to Bob, not Adam. Here's why:

1. The sentence implies that Adam had a sudden run of good luck, which changed the outcome of the game.
2. If Adam hadn't had this luck, ""he"" (referring to Bob) would have won.
3. This makes sense because Bob was initially ""way ahead"" in the game.

Therefore, ""he"" refers to Bob, who would have won if Adam hadn't had a lucky streak.",0,0
644,"Bob was playing cards with Adam and was way ahead. If Adam hadn't had a sudden run of good luck, he would have lost.",he,"0: Bob, 1: Adam, 2: Neither","Let's analyze the sentence to determine who ""he"" refers to:

1. The sentence mentions that Bob was way ahead in the card game.
2. It then states that Adam had a sudden run of good luck.
3. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the context of who would have lost if Adam hadn't had good luck.

Given this information, we can deduce that ""he"" refers to Adam. If Adam hadn't had good luck, Adam would have lost. This makes sense because Bob was already ahead, so without Adam's luck changing, Adam would have been the one to lose.",1,1
645,"Adam can't leave work here until Bob arrives to replace him. If Bob had left home for work on time, he would be gone by this time.",he,"0: Adam, 1: Bob, 2: Neither","Let's analyze the pronoun ""he"" in the context:

1. The first sentence mentions both Adam and Bob, but uses ""him"" to refer to Adam.
2. The second sentence starts with ""If Bob had left home for work on time,"" which sets Bob as the subject.
3. The pronoun ""he"" in the second sentence is referring to the subject of that sentence, which is Bob.
4. The statement ""he would be gone by this time"" logically applies to Bob, as it's discussing his arrival at work.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" in this context refers to Bob.",0,1
646,"Adam can't leave work here until Bob arrives to replace him. If Bob had left home for work on time, he would be here by this time.",he,"0: Adam, 1: Bob, 2: Neither","In this text, we need to determine which person the pronoun ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. The first sentence mentions both Adam and Bob, with ""him"" referring to Adam.
2. The second sentence starts with ""If Bob had left home for work on time,"" which introduces a hypothetical scenario about Bob.
3. The pronoun ""he"" appears in the clause ""he would be here by this time.""

Given this context, it's clear that ""he"" refers to Bob. The sentence is discussing Bob's potential arrival time if he had left home on time. It wouldn't make sense for ""he"" to refer to Adam in this context, as Adam is already at work and waiting for Bob to arrive.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Bob, which corresponds to candidate 1.",1,1
647,"If the con artist has succeeded in fooling Sam, he would have gotten a lot of money.",he,"0: The con artist, 1: Sam, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence is discussing a hypothetical situation where a con artist has succeeded in fooling Sam.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""he would have gotten a lot of money.""
3. Logically, the person who would get a lot of money from fooling someone would be the con artist, not the person being fooled (Sam).

Therefore, ""he"" most likely refers to the con artist, as the con artist would be the one to benefit financially from successfully fooling Sam.",0,0
648,"If the con artist has succeeded in fooling Sam, he would have lost a lot of money.",he,"0: The con artist, 1: Sam, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence is a conditional statement about a hypothetical situation.
2. The first part of the sentence mentions ""the con artist"" and ""Sam.""
3. The second part of the sentence uses ""he"" and talks about losing money.

Given the context, it's more logical that Sam would be the one losing money if he were fooled by the con artist. Con artists typically gain money by fooling others, not lose it. Therefore, ""he"" in this sentence most likely refers to Sam.",1,1
649,"It was a summer afternoon, and the dog was sitting in the middle of the lawn. After a while, it got up and moved to a spot under the tree, because it was hot.",it,"0: The dog, 1: The spot under the tree, 2: Neither","Let's analyze the pronoun ""it"" in the given text:

1. The first ""it"" in the sentence ""After a while, it got up and moved to a spot under the tree"" clearly refers to the dog. The dog is the subject that performed the action of getting up and moving.

2. The second ""it"" in the phrase ""because it was hot"" is more ambiguous. However, in this context, it's most likely referring to the general weather or temperature, not specifically to the dog or the spot under the tree.

Given that we're asked to choose between the dog, the spot under the tree, or neither, the most appropriate answer is the dog. The pronoun ""it"" primarily refers to the dog in this text, even though the last instance might be referring to the weather (which isn't one of the given options).",0,0

1. The first ""it"" in the sentence ""After a while, it got up and moved to a spot under the tree"" clearly refers to the dog. The dog is the subject that performed the action of getting up and moving.

2. The second ""it"" in the phrase ""because it was cooler"" refers to the spot under the tree. This is implied by the context, as the dog moved to that spot because that location was cooler.

3. The question asks specifically about the pronoun ""it"" without specifying which instance. However, since the first occurrence of ""it"" in the text refers to the dog, and the dog is the main subject of the passage, it's most logical to assume that the question is asking about this primary usage of the pronoun.

Therefore, the pronoun ""it"" primarily refers to the dog in this text.",1,0
651,"The cat was lying by the mouse hole waiting for the mouse, but it was too impatient.",it,"0: The cat, 1: The mouse, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""it"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and grammatical structure of the sentence.

1. The sentence describes two animals: the cat and the mouse.
2. The pronoun ""it"" is used at the end of the sentence in the clause ""but it was too impatient.""
3. The main subject of the sentence is ""The cat,"" which is described as waiting for the mouse.
4. The quality of being ""impatient"" is more likely to be associated with the cat in this context, as it is waiting for its prey.
5. Grammatically, ""it"" is more likely to refer to the subject of the main clause (the cat) rather than the object of a prepositional phrase (the mouse).

Based on these observations, it is most logical to conclude that ""it"" refers to the cat.",0,0
652,"The cat was lying by the mouse hole waiting for the mouse, but it was too cautious.",it,"0: The cat, 1: The mouse, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""it"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and meaning of the sentence:

1. The sentence describes a scene where a cat is waiting by a mouse hole for a mouse.
2. The pronoun ""it"" is used at the end of the sentence, followed by ""was too cautious.""
3. Being cautious in this context is more likely to be associated with the mouse rather than the cat.
4. The cat is described as waiting, which implies it is actively trying to catch the mouse.
5. The mouse, on the other hand, would need to be cautious to avoid being caught by the cat.

Based on this analysis, it is more logical and contextually appropriate for ""it"" to refer to the mouse. The mouse being cautious explains why the cat is still waiting and hasn't caught it yet.",1,1
653,Anne gave birth to a daughter last month. She is a very charming woman.,She,"0: Anne, 1: Anne's daughter, 2: Neither","In this context, ""She"" most likely refers to Anne for the following reasons:

1. The sentence ""She is a very charming woman"" follows immediately after mentioning Anne giving birth.
2. The description ""very charming woman"" is more likely to be used for an adult (Anne) rather than a newborn baby (Anne's daughter).
3. It's more natural to describe the mother's characteristics after mentioning a birth, rather than immediately describing the newborn.
4. The use of ""woman"" in the description further supports that it's referring to an adult, which would be Anne, not her newborn daughter.

Therefore, the pronoun ""She"" most likely refers to Anne.",0,0
654,Anne gave birth to a daughter last month. She is a very charming baby.,She,"0: Anne, 1: Anne's daughter, 2: Neither","In this context, the pronoun ""She"" most likely refers to Anne's daughter for the following reasons:

1. The sentence immediately following the introduction of Anne's daughter uses ""She.""
2. The description ""is a very charming baby"" clearly applies to a baby, not to Anne.
3. It's more natural and common to describe a newborn as charming rather than the mother who gave birth.
4. The use of present tense ""is"" suggests we're talking about the current state of the baby, not Anne's past action of giving birth.

Therefore, the pronoun ""She"" in this context refers to Anne's daughter, which is candidate 1.",1,1
655,"Alice tried frantically to stop her daughter from chatting at the party, leaving us to wonder why she was behaving so strangely.",she,"0: Alice, 1: Alice's daughter, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and sentence structure:

1. The sentence describes two people: Alice and her daughter.
2. Alice is the subject of the main clause, performing the action of trying to stop her daughter.
3. The pronoun ""she"" appears in the second part of the sentence, which is describing someone's strange behavior.
4. Logically, it makes more sense that Alice would be the one behaving strangely, as she is the one trying to frantically stop her daughter from chatting.
5. The daughter's action (chatting) is not described as strange, but rather as something Alice is trying to prevent.

Given this analysis, it is most likely that ""she"" refers to Alice, as Alice's behavior (trying frantically to stop her daughter) is what is being described as strange.",0,0

4. It would be unusual for Alice to be described as behaving strangely for trying to stop her daughter from barking, as this is a normal parental action.
5. The sentence structure suggests that ""she"" refers to the most recently mentioned subject, which is Alice's daughter.

Based on these points, it is most logical to conclude that ""she"" refers to Alice's daughter, who was barking and behaving strangely at the party.",1,1
657,"I saw Jim yelling at some guy in a military uniform with a huge red beard. I don't know why he was, but he looked very unhappy.",he,"0: Jim, 1: the guy in uniform, 2: Neither","In this text, we need to determine which ""he"" the pronoun refers to. There are two instances of ""he"" in the last sentence:

1. ""I don't know why he was""
2. ""but he looked very unhappy""

Both of these ""he"" pronouns likely refer to the same person. Given the context, it's more likely that these pronouns refer to Jim rather than the guy in uniform. The reasons for this are:

1. Jim is mentioned first in the sentence and is the subject of the action (yelling).
2. The sentence structure suggests that Jim is the main focus of the narrative.
3. It's more natural to describe Jim's emotional state (looking unhappy) as he was the one yelling, rather than the guy being yelled at.

While it's possible that the guy in uniform was unhappy, the context more strongly suggests that Jim was the one who ""looked very unhappy"" after yelling.",0,0

5. The description ""he looked very unhappy"" could apply to either person, as Jim was yelling and the other guy was being yelled at.

Given these points, it's more likely that ""he"" refers to ""the guy in uniform"" rather than Jim. The speaker's unfamiliarity with this person and the focus on describing him (military uniform, huge red beard) support this interpretation.",1,1
659,The fish ate the worm. It was hungry.,It,"0: The fish, 1: The worm, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""It"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and logic of the sentences:

1. ""The fish ate the worm."" - This sentence establishes the action of the fish eating the worm.
2. ""It was hungry."" - This sentence provides additional information about the subject's state.

Logically, the pronoun ""It"" is more likely to refer to the fish for the following reasons:
1. The fish is the subject and the active entity in the first sentence.
2. Being hungry is a motivation for eating, which aligns with the fish's action of eating the worm.
3. It's more natural to describe the eater (the fish) as hungry rather than the eaten (the worm).

1. The worm is the object being eaten, and food is typically described as tasty.
2. It's more natural to describe the taste of what was eaten (the worm) rather than the eater (the fish).
3. The pronoun ""it"" is often used to refer to the most recently mentioned noun, which in this case is ""the worm.""

Therefore, the pronoun ""It"" most likely refers to ""the worm.""",1,1

The context suggests that the speaker was attempting to insert something into the keyhole, which would logically be the key. The sentence states, ""I couldn't get it in,"" implying that ""it"" is the object being inserted. Since keys are typically inserted into keyholes, and the chewing gum is described as already being in the keyhole, ""it"" must refer to the key.",0,0
662,"I was trying to open the lock with the key, but someone had filled the keyhole with chewing gum, and I couldn't get it out.",it,"0: The key, 1: The chewing gum, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""it"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence mentions two objects: the key and the chewing gum.
2. The pronoun ""it"" appears in the phrase ""I couldn't get it out.""
3. The action of ""getting out"" is more logically associated with the chewing gum than the key.
4. The chewing gum is described as being in the keyhole, which is preventing the use of the key.
5. It makes more sense that the speaker is trying to remove the chewing gum from the keyhole rather than trying to remove the key.

Based on this analysis, the pronoun ""it"" most likely refers to the chewing gum.",1,1
663,"The dog chased the cat, which ran up a tree. It waited at the bottom.",It,"0: The dog, 1: The cat, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""It"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and the most logical subject for the action described.

1. The first sentence describes two actions:
   - The dog chased the cat
   - The cat ran up a tree

2. The second sentence states: ""It waited at the bottom.""

3. Considering the context:
   - The cat has just run up the tree, so it's unlikely to be waiting at the bottom.
   - The dog, having chased the cat, would logically be the one waiting at the bottom of the tree.

4. The pronoun ""It"" is more likely to refer to the dog, as it makes the most sense in the context of the story.

Therefore, the pronoun ""It"" most likely refers to the dog.",0,0
664,"The dog chased the cat, which ran up a tree. It waited at the top.",It,"0: The dog, 1: The cat, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""It"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and the most logical subject for the action described.

1. The first sentence describes two actions:
   - The dog chased the cat
   - The cat ran up a tree

2. The second sentence states: ""It waited at the top.""

3. Considering the context:
   - The dog was chasing, so it's unlikely to be waiting at the top of the tree.
   - The cat ran up the tree, so it makes more sense for the cat to be waiting at the top.

4. The pronoun ""It"" is more likely referring to the subject that ended up at the top of the tree, which is the cat.

Therefore, the most logical referent for ""It"" is the cat.",1,1
665,"In the storm, the tree fell down and crashed through the roof of my house. Now, I have to get it removed.",it,"0: The tree, 1: The roof, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""it"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and grammatical structure of the sentences.

1. The first sentence introduces two main objects: the tree and the roof.
2. The second sentence uses the pronoun ""it"" in the phrase ""get it removed.""

When considering which object needs to be removed, it's more logical that the tree would need to be removed rather than the roof. The tree fell and caused damage, so it would be the object that needs to be dealt with.

Additionally, ""it"" is singular, which matches with ""the tree"" (singular) rather than ""the roof"" (also singular, but less likely to be removed in this context).

Therefore, the pronoun ""it"" most likely refers to ""the tree.""",0,0
666,"In the storm, the tree fell down and crashed through the roof of my house. Now, I have to get it repaired.",it,"0: The tree, 1: The roof, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""it"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and grammatical structure of the sentences.

1. The first sentence mentions two main objects: the tree and the roof.
2. The second sentence uses the pronoun ""it"" in the phrase ""get it repaired.""
3. Logically, one would repair a roof, not a tree.
4. The roof is the object that was damaged by the tree falling on it.
5. It makes more sense to say ""Now, I have to get the roof repaired"" rather than ""Now, I have to get the tree repaired.""

Based on this analysis, the pronoun ""it"" most likely refers to ""the roof"" rather than ""the tree.""",1,1
667,The customer walked into the bank and stabbed one of the tellers. He was immediately taken to the police station.,He,"0: The customer, 1: The teller, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this situation step by step:

1. The text describes two main characters: the customer and the teller.
2. The pronoun ""He"" is used in the second sentence.
3. The second sentence states that ""He was immediately taken to the police station.""
4. Given the context, it's more likely that the person who committed the crime (stabbing the teller) would be taken to the police station.
5. The customer is the one who performed the action of stabbing the teller.
6. Therefore, it's logical to conclude that ""He"" refers to the customer, not the teller.

The pronoun ""He"" most likely refers to the customer, as he would be the one arrested and taken to the police station for committing the crime.",0,0
668,The customer walked into the bank and stabbed one of the tellers. He was immediately taken to the hospital.,He,"0: The customer, 1: The teller, 2: Neither","To determine who ""He"" refers to in this context, we need to analyze the sequence of events and the most logical interpretation:

1. The customer walked into the bank.
2. The customer stabbed one of the tellers.
3. ""He"" was immediately taken to the hospital.

Given this sequence, it's most likely that ""He"" refers to the teller for the following reasons:

1. The teller is the one who was stabbed, which would necessitate immediate medical attention.
2. It's more common for a victim of violence to be taken to the hospital than the perpetrator.
3. The use of ""immediately"" suggests a direct response to the stabbing, which would apply to the victim (teller) rather than the attacker (customer).

While it's possible that the customer could have been injured in some way (e.g., during apprehension), this is not mentioned in the text and would be a less likely interpretation based on the information given.

Therefore, the pronoun ""He"" most likely refers to the teller.",1,"1

1. The first sentence introduces two characters: John and a man.
2. The second sentence starts with ""He was very annoyed.""
3. Given the context, it's more logical that John would be annoyed by the humming and whistling, rather than the man who was doing the humming and whistling being annoyed by his own actions.
4. The pronoun ""He"" is more likely to refer to the main subject of the first sentence, which is John.

Therefore, the pronoun ""He"" most likely refers to John, who was annoyed by the man's humming and whistling in the library where he was trying to do research.",0,0
670,John was doing research in the library when he heard a man humming and whistling. He was very annoying.,He,"0: John, 1: The man, 2: Neither","In this context, the pronoun 'He' in the sentence 'He was very annoying' is more likely referring to 'the man' who was humming and whistling, rather than John. This is because:

1. The sentence immediately before introduces a new character, 'a man humming and whistling'.
2. The description 'very annoying' is more logically connected to the action of humming and whistling, which could be disruptive in a library setting.
3. If 'He' referred to John, it would be an abrupt and unclear shift in the narrative focus.

Therefore, the pronoun 'He' most likely refers to 'the man' (candidate 1) rather than John (candidate 0).",1,1

1. The first sentence introduces two characters: John and a man juggling watermelons.
2. The second sentence starts with ""He was very impressed.""

   a. John is the subject of the first sentence and the main focus of the narrative.
   b. It's more natural for John to be impressed by the juggler's skills than for the juggler to be impressed by his own actions.
   c. If the pronoun referred to the juggler, it would be more common to use ""The man"" or ""The juggler"" to avoid ambiguity.

Therefore, the pronoun ""He"" most likely refers to John, who was impressed by the man juggling watermelons.",0,0

1. The first sentence introduces two characters: John and a man juggling watermelons.
2. The second sentence starts with ""He was very impressive.""
3. The pronoun ""He"" is more likely to refer to the person performing an impressive action, which in this case is the man juggling watermelons.
4. Juggling watermelons is an unusual and potentially difficult skill, which would be considered impressive.
5. John was simply jogging, which is not typically considered an impressive action in this context.

Based on this reasoning, it is more logical that ""He"" refers to the juggler (the man juggling watermelons) rather than John.",1,1

1. The pronoun ""He"" in the last sentence (""He was very ill"") is the one we need to resolve.

2. The context provides two male characters: Bob and Carl.

3. The first sentence states that ""Bob collapsed on the sidewalk,"" which strongly suggests that Bob is ill or in distress.

4. The second sentence mentions Carl coming to help, implying that Carl is not the one who is ill.

5. The final sentence, ""He was very ill,"" logically refers back to the person who collapsed, which is Bob.

Given this reasoning, it's clear that the pronoun ""He"" in the last sentence refers to Bob, who was the one who collapsed and is described as being very ill.",0,0
674,Bob collapsed on the sidewalk. Soon he saw Carl coming to help. He was very concerned.,He,"0: Bob, 1: Carl, 2: Neither","In this scenario, we need to determine who ""He"" refers to in the sentence ""He was very concerned."" Let's analyze the context:

1. Bob collapsed on the sidewalk.
2. Carl was coming to help.
3. Someone was very concerned.

Given the situation, it's more likely that Carl, who was coming to help, would be the one who was very concerned about Bob's condition. Bob, having collapsed, would be less likely to be described as ""very concerned"" in this context.

Therefore, ""He"" in the last sentence most likely refers to Carl, who was coming to help and would naturally be concerned about Bob's condition.",1,1

1. The sentence mentions two groups: ""Sam and Amy"" and ""Amy's parents"".
2. The pronoun ""they"" is used at the end of the sentence in the phrase ""because they are fifteen"".
3. It's more logical that the age of fifteen would refer to Sam and Amy, rather than Amy's parents.
4. The fact that Amy's parents are unhappy about the relationship makes more sense if Sam and Amy are young (fifteen years old).
5. It's unlikely that ""they"" refers to Amy's parents being fifteen, as parents are typically adults.

Based on this analysis, the pronoun ""they"" most likely refers to Sam and Amy, who are fifteen years old, which explains why Amy's parents are unhappy about their relationship.",0,0
676,"Sam and Amy are passionately in love, but Amy's parents are unhappy about it, because they are snobs.",they,"0: Sam and Amy, 1: Amy's parents, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The first part of the sentence talks about Sam and Amy being in love.
2. The second part introduces Amy's parents and their feelings about the relationship.
3. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the context of being ""snobs.""

Given this information, it's more logical that ""they"" refers to Amy's parents rather than Sam and Amy. The sentence structure suggests that Amy's parents are the ones who are unhappy about the relationship and are described as snobs. It wouldn't make sense for Sam and Amy to be described as snobs in this context, as they are the ones in love and the subject of the parents' disapproval.

Therefore, the pronoun ""they"" most likely refers to Amy's parents.",1,1
677,"Mark told Pete many lies about himself, which Pete included in his book. He should have been more truthful.",He,"0: Mark, 1: Pete, 2: Neither","To determine who ""He"" refers to in this context, we need to analyze the sentence structure and the logical flow of the text:

1. The first sentence states that Mark told Pete lies about himself.
2. Pete included these lies in his book.
3. The pronoun ""He"" is used in the last sentence, stating that this person ""should have been more truthful.""

Given this information, it's more likely that ""He"" refers to Mark for the following reasons:
- Mark is the one who told the lies initially.
- The statement ""should have been more truthful"" implies that this person was not truthful before.
- It makes more sense for the text to criticize the person who originated the lies (Mark) rather than the person who merely included them in a book (Pete).

Therefore, the pronoun ""He"" most likely refers to Mark.",0,0
678,"Mark told Pete many lies about himself, which Pete included in his book. He should have been more skeptical.",He,"0: Mark, 1: Pete, 2: Neither","To determine who ""He"" refers to in this context, we need to analyze the sentence structure and logical flow:

1. Mark told Pete lies about himself (Mark).
2. Pete included these lies in his book.
3. The last sentence states ""He should have been more skeptical.""

Given this information, it's more logical that ""He"" refers to Pete for the following reasons:
- Pete is the one who included the lies in his book, suggesting he believed them.
- Being skeptical would be more appropriate for the person receiving information (Pete) rather than the person telling lies (Mark).
- The sentence implies that someone should have questioned the information they received, which aligns more with Pete's position in this scenario.

1. Joe has sold his old house.
2. Joe has bought a new house.
3. The pronoun ""it"" is used in the sentence ""He will be moving out of it on Thursday.""

The phrase ""moving out of"" implies that Joe is leaving a place he currently occupies. Since Joe has sold his old house, it's logical that he is still living in it until the moving day. He wouldn't be ""moving out of"" the new house because he hasn't moved into it yet.

Therefore, ""it"" in this context refers to the old house that Joe is leaving.",0,0

This is evident because:

1. The context indicates that Joe has sold his old house, so he wouldn't be moving into that one.
2. The sentence mentions that Joe bought a new house.
3. The action of ""moving into"" is typically associated with a new residence.

Therefore, ""it"" refers to the new house that Joe has purchased and will be moving into on Thursday.",1,1

1. The first sentence introduces ""Many people"" and ""Paul's books"".
2. The second sentence starts with ""They are gripped"", which is describing a state or reaction.
3. The reason given for this state is ""because Paul writes so well"".

Given this context, ""They"" is most likely referring to ""Many people"" for the following reasons:
- People can be ""gripped"" by a book, meaning they are captivated or intensely interested.
- The sentence explains that this gripped state is due to Paul's writing, which implies that it's the readers (people) who are experiencing this reaction.
- It wouldn't make sense for ""Paul's books"" to be gripped by Paul's writing, as books are inanimate objects.

Therefore, the pronoun ""They"" most likely refers to ""Many people"" (candidate 0).",0,0
682,Many people start to read Paul's books and can't put them down. They are popular because Paul writes so well.,They,"0: People, 1: Paul's books, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""They"" most likely refers to ""Paul's books"" for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""They"" is the subject of the second sentence, which is describing why something is popular.

2. The context indicates that Paul's books are the main topic of discussion, as the first sentence mentions people reading them and not being able to put them down.

3. It's more logical for books to be popular because they are well-written, rather than people being popular for that reason.

4. While ""People"" is mentioned at the beginning of the first sentence, it's not the focus of the statement and doesn't flow naturally as the subject of the second sentence.

Therefore, the pronoun ""They"" most likely refers to ""Paul's books"" (candidate 1).",1,1

1. The flute is a physical object that can be possessed for a long time, which aligns with the statement ""She has had it since she was a child.""

2. It's more common for someone to have owned a musical instrument since childhood rather than a specific piece of music.

3. The sentence structure suggests that ""it"" refers to something mentioned earlier in the text, and the flute is the first object introduced.

4. While it's possible to know a piece of music since childhood, the phrasing ""has had it"" implies ownership of a physical object rather than knowledge of a musical composition.

Therefore, the pronoun ""it"" most likely refers to the flute (candidate 0).",0,0
684,Mary took out her flute and played one of her favorite pieces. She has loved it since she was a child.,it,"0: The flute, 1: The piece, 2: Neither","In this context, the pronoun ""it"" most likely refers to ""the piece"" that Mary played on her flute. The reasoning is as follows:

1. The text mentions that Mary played ""one of her favorite pieces"" on her flute.
2. The next sentence states ""She has loved it since she was a child.""
3. It's more natural and logical for Mary to have loved a musical piece since childhood, rather than the flute itself (although that's not impossible).
4. The pronoun ""it"" is used in relation to something Mary has loved for a long time, which aligns better with a musical piece than the instrument.

1. The sentence mentions two objects: a chair and a piano.
2. The pronoun ""it"" is used in the clause ""but it was broken"".
3. The consequence of ""it"" being broken is that Sam had to stand instead.

Given this information, we can deduce that ""it"" most likely refers to the chair, not the piano. If the piano was broken, it wouldn't necessarily result in Sam having to stand. However, if the chair was broken, it would explain why Sam couldn't sit and had to stand instead.

3. The consequence of ""it"" being broken is that Sam had to sing instead.

Given this information, we can deduce that ""it"" most likely refers to the piano, not the chair. Here's why:

- If the chair was broken, it wouldn't necessarily prevent Sam from playing the piano.
- The fact that Sam had to sing instead strongly suggests that he couldn't play the piano.
- It's more logical that a broken piano would lead to singing as an alternative, rather than a broken chair.

2. The context suggests that something needs to be kept dry due to the rain.

3. Between the two candidates, ""the newspaper"" and ""the backpack,"" it makes more sense that the newspaper is the item that needs to be kept dry.

4. Newspapers are made of paper, which is susceptible to water damage, while backpacks are typically made of water-resistant materials.

5. The action of carrying the newspaper in the backpack implies that the backpack is being used to protect the newspaper from the rain.

Therefore, the pronoun ""it"" in ""to keep it dry"" most likely refers to the newspaper.",0,0

1. The pronoun ""it"" appears twice in the sentence, but we're focusing on the second occurrence: ""to keep it dry.""

2. The context suggests that something needs to be kept dry due to the rain.

3. Between a newspaper and a backpack, a newspaper is much more susceptible to water damage and is typically the item that needs protection from rain.

4. The sentence structure implies that the newspaper was carried over the backpack as a protective measure, which further supports the idea that the newspaper is the item being kept dry.

5. It wouldn't make sense to say the backpack is being kept dry by carrying the newspaper over it, as this action wouldn't effectively protect the backpack from rain.

Therefore, the pronoun ""it"" in ""to keep it dry"" most likely refers to the newspaper.",1,0

1. The first sentence mentions that Sara borrowed ""the book"" from the library.
2. The purpose of borrowing the book is stated as ""she needs it for an article she is working on."" Here, ""it"" clearly refers to the book, which is needed for the article.
3. In the second sentence, ""She reads it when she gets home from work"" also refers to the book. It's more logical that Sara would read the book she borrowed, rather than reading the article she is working on.

The article is mentioned as something Sara is working on, but it's not the object being referred to by ""it"" in either instance.",0,0
690,Sara borrowed the book from the library because she needs it for an article she is working on. She writes it when she gets home from work.,it,"0: The book, 1: The article, 2: Neither","In this text, there are two instances of 'it' that we need to consider. Let's analyze them separately:

1. The first 'it' in 'she needs it for an article she is working on' clearly refers to 'the book'. Sara borrowed the book because she needs it for her article.

2. The second 'it' in 'She writes it when she gets home from work' refers to 'the article'. This is evident because writing typically refers to composing an article, not a book that was borrowed from the library.

Since the pronoun we're asked about is 'it', and we have two instances referring to different things, we need to consider which is more prominent or the main focus of the sentence. The book is mentioned first and is the object that Sara borrowed, making it the primary subject of the sentence. The article is secondary, mentioned as the reason for borrowing the book.

Therefore, the pronoun 'it' more prominently refers to 'the book' in this context.",1,0
691,"This morning, Joey built a sand castle on the beach, and put a toy flag in the highest tower, but this afternoon the tide knocked it down.",it,"0: The sand castle, 1: The flag, 2: Neither","To determine what ""it"" refers to in this sentence, we need to consider the context and the most logical antecedent. 

The sentence describes two main objects: the sand castle and the toy flag. The pronoun ""it"" appears in the phrase ""the tide knocked it down."" 

When considering what can be knocked down by a tide, a sand castle is a much more likely candidate than a small toy flag. Sand castles are built on the beach and are vulnerable to being washed away or knocked down by the incoming tide. A small flag, even if it fell, wouldn't typically be described as being ""knocked down"" by the tide.

Furthermore, the sand castle is the main object being discussed in the sentence, with the flag being a smaller detail added to it. It's more natural for the pronoun to refer back to the main subject of the sentence.

Therefore, the most logical conclusion is that ""it"" refers to the sand castle.",0,0
692,"This morning, Joey built a sand castle on the beach, and put a toy flag in the highest tower, but this afternoon the wind knocked it down.",it,"0: The sand castle, 1: The flag, 2: Neither","To determine what ""it"" refers to in this sentence, we need to consider the context and the most logical antecedent. 

The sentence describes two main objects: the sand castle and the toy flag. The pronoun ""it"" appears in the phrase ""the wind knocked it down."" 

When we consider what can be knocked down by the wind, both a sand castle and a flag are possible candidates. However, the sentence structure and the use of ""it"" (singular) suggest that we're referring to a single object.

Given that the sand castle is the main structure described, and it's more significant to mention a sand castle being knocked down than just a flag, it's more likely that ""it"" refers to the sand castle.

Additionally, the sentence mentions ""this afternoon,"" implying a passage of time since the morning when Joey built the sand castle. This temporal shift supports the idea that we're talking about the fate of the sand castle as a whole, rather than just the flag.

Therefore, the most logical conclusion is that ""it"" refers to the sand castle.",1,"0

693,"Jane knocked on Susan's door, but there was no answer. She was disappointed.",She,"0: Jane, 1: Susan, 2: Neither","To determine who ""She"" refers to in this context, we need to analyze the sentence structure and the logical flow of events:

1. Jane is the subject of the first clause, performing the action of knocking on Susan's door.
2. The second clause states that there was no answer.
3. The final sentence says ""She was disappointed.""

Given this sequence of events, it's most logical that Jane would be the one feeling disappointed. Jane took the action of knocking, and not receiving an answer would naturally lead to disappointment. Susan, being the one whose door was knocked on, is not described as taking any action or having any reaction in this scenario.

Therefore, ""She"" most likely refers to Jane.",0,0

1. The first sentence states that Jane knocked on Susan's door, but there was no answer.
2. The second sentence, ""She was out,"" provides additional information about why there was no answer.

Given this information, it's more logical that ""She"" refers to Susan rather than Jane. Here's why:

- If Susan was out, it explains why there was no answer when Jane knocked on her door.
- If ""She"" referred to Jane being out, it wouldn't make sense in the context of Jane actively knocking on Susan's door.

695,"Jane knocked on the door, and Susan answered it. She invited her to come out.",She,"0: Jane, 1: Susan, 2: Neither","To determine who ""She"" refers to in this context, we need to analyze the sequence of events and the logical flow of the sentence:

1. Jane knocked on the door.
2. Susan answered it.
3. ""She"" invited ""her"" to come out.

Given this sequence, it's more likely that ""She"" refers to Susan because:
- Susan was the last person mentioned before the pronoun ""She"" appears.
- Susan is in the position of having just answered the door, so she would be the one to invite someone in (or in this case, out).
- It makes more sense for the person inside (Susan) to invite the person outside (Jane) to come out, rather than the other way around.

Therefore, the pronoun ""She"" most likely refers to Susan.",0,1
696,"Jane knocked on the door, and Susan answered it. She invited her to come in.",She,"0: Jane, 1: Susan, 2: Neither","To determine who ""She"" refers to in this context, we need to analyze the sequence of events and the most logical subject for the action of inviting.

1. Jane knocked on the door.
2. Susan answered it.
3. ""She"" invited ""her"" to come in.

Given this sequence, it's more likely that Susan, who answered the door, would be the one inviting Jane to come in. It would be less logical for Jane, who was outside knocking, to invite Susan into her own house.

Therefore, ""She"" most likely refers to Susan in this context.",1,1
697,"Sam took French classes from Adam, because he was eager to speak it fluently.",he,"0: Sam, 1: Adam, 2: Neither","To determine who ""he"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and logical flow:

1. The sentence states that ""Sam took French classes from Adam.""
2. The reason given is ""because he was eager to speak it fluently.""

The pronoun ""he"" is more likely to refer to Sam for the following reasons:
- Sam is the subject of the main clause and the one taking the action (taking French classes).
- The eagerness to speak French fluently is a logical motivation for taking French classes.
- It makes more sense for the student (Sam) to be eager to speak French fluently, rather than the teacher (Adam).

While it's possible that Adam could be eager for Sam to speak French fluently, this interpretation is less likely given the structure and context of the sentence.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Sam.",0,0
698,"Sam took French classes from Adam, because he was known to speak it fluently.",he,"0: Sam, 1: Adam, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence states that ""Sam took French classes from Adam.""
2. The reason given for this action is ""because he was known to speak it fluently.""

The pronoun ""he"" is more likely to refer to Adam for the following reasons:
1. It makes more sense for Sam to take French classes from Adam because Adam is known to speak French fluently.
2. The phrase ""was known to"" suggests a reputation or established fact, which aligns better with a teacher (Adam) rather than a student (Sam).
3. If ""he"" referred to Sam, it wouldn't make sense for Sam to take French classes if he already spoke it fluently.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Adam.",1,1
699,"The path to the lake was blocked, so we couldn't use it.",it,"0: The path, 1: The lake, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""it"" most likely refers to ""the path"" rather than ""the lake"". The sentence structure suggests that ""it"" is the object that couldn't be used due to being blocked. Logically, a path is something that can be used or not used for travel, while a lake is typically not referred to in terms of being ""used"" in this context. Therefore, ""it"" is more likely to refer to ""the path"".",0,0
700,"The path to the lake was blocked, so we couldn't reach it.",it,"0: The path, 1: The lake, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""it"" most likely refers to ""the lake"" for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""it"" is the destination or goal that couldn't be reached.
2. ""The path"" is mentioned as being blocked, which implies it's not the object being referred to by ""it"".
3. Logically, people would typically try to reach a lake, not a path.
4. The phrase ""couldn't reach it"" makes more sense when ""it"" refers to ""the lake"" as the intended destination.

Therefore, the pronoun ""it"" most likely refers to ""the lake"" (candidate 1).",1,1
701,"The sun was covered by a thick cloud all morning, but luckily, by the time the picnic started, it was out.",it,"0: The sun, 1: The cloud, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. The pronoun ""it"" is used at the end of the sentence in ""it was out.""
2. The context suggests that something changed from the morning to the time of the picnic.
3. In the morning, ""The sun was covered by a thick cloud.""
4. By the time of the picnic, the situation had changed - ""it was out.""

Given this information, ""it"" most likely refers to the sun. The sentence is describing how the sun, which was initially covered by a cloud, became visible (""out"") by the time the picnic started. This makes sense in the context of weather changing for a picnic.

The cloud is not a logical referent for ""it was out"" because clouds don't typically ""come out"" - they appear, dissipate, or move away.

Therefore, the pronoun ""it"" refers to ""The sun"" (candidate 0).",0,0
702,"The sun was covered by a thick cloud all morning, but luckily, by the time the picnic started, it was gone.",it,"0: The sun, 1: The cloud, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""it"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and logic of the sentence:

1. The sentence describes two main elements: the sun and a thick cloud.
2. The first part of the sentence states that ""The sun was covered by a thick cloud all morning.""
3. The second part says, ""by the time the picnic started, it was gone.""
4. Logically, for the picnic to start in better conditions, it would make sense for the cloud to be gone, not the sun.
5. The sun being ""gone"" would mean darkness, which is unlikely to be a positive development for a picnic.
6. Therefore, ""it"" most likely refers to the cloud that was covering the sun, which disappeared to allow for a pleasant picnic.

Based on this reasoning, the pronoun ""it"" refers to the cloud.",1,1
703,"We went to the lake, because a shark had been seen at the ocean beach, so it was a safer place to swim.",it,"0: The lake, 1: The ocean beach, 2: Neither","Let's analyze the sentence to determine what ""it"" refers to:

1. The sentence mentions two locations: the lake and the ocean beach.
2. The pronoun ""it"" is used in the phrase ""it was a safer place to swim.""
3. The context indicates that people went to the lake because a shark had been seen at the ocean beach.
4. The implication is that they chose the lake as a safer alternative to the ocean beach.

Given this information, ""it"" most likely refers to the lake. The lake is described as ""a safer place to swim"" in contrast to the ocean beach where a shark had been seen.",0,0
704,"We went to the lake, because a shark had been seen at the ocean beach, so it was a dangerous place to swim.",it,"0: The lake, 1: The ocean beach, 2: Neither","Let's analyze the sentence to determine what ""it"" refers to:

1. The sentence mentions two locations: the lake and the ocean beach.
2. The pronoun ""it"" is used in the phrase ""it was a dangerous place to swim.""
3. The context indicates that a shark had been seen at the ocean beach.
4. The presence of the shark makes the ocean beach dangerous for swimming.
5. The lake is mentioned as an alternative destination, implying it's safer.

Given this information, ""it"" clearly refers to the ocean beach, as it is described as the dangerous place to swim due to the shark sighting. The lake is presented as a safer alternative, so ""it"" cannot be referring to the lake.",1,1
705,"Sam tried to paint a picture of shepherds with sheep, but they ended up looking more like golfers.",they,"0: The shepherds, 1: The sheep, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" refers to either the shepherds or the sheep, as these are the subjects that Sam was attempting to paint. The pronoun ""they"" is used to describe what ended up looking more like golfers. Given the context, it's more likely that ""they"" refers to the shepherds for the following reasons:

1. Shepherds are human figures, and golfers are also human figures. It's more plausible that human figures (shepherds) would be mistaken for other human figures (golfers) rather than animals (sheep) being mistaken for human figures.

2. Shepherds are mentioned first in the sentence, making them the more prominent subject and a more likely antecedent for the pronoun.

3. It's more common to describe human figures as ""looking like"" something else, rather than animals.

Therefore, the most logical conclusion is that ""they"" refers to the shepherds.",0,0
706,"Sam tried to paint a picture of shepherds with sheep, but they ended up looking more like dogs.",they,"0: The shepherds, 1: The sheep, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" refers to the sheep, not the shepherds or any other subject. The context suggests that something in the painting ended up looking different from what was intended. Since the sentence mentions that Sam was trying to paint shepherds with sheep, but ""they"" ended up looking more like dogs, it's logical to conclude that ""they"" refers to the sheep in the painting. Shepherds are people, so it would be unusual for them to be mistaken for dogs in a painting. Therefore, it's more likely that the sheep in the painting ended up resembling dogs.",1,1
707,"Mary tucked her daughter Anne into bed, so that she could work.",she,"0: Mary, 1: Mary's daughter, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to - Mary or her daughter Anne. The key is in the context and the logical flow of the sentence.

The sentence states that ""Mary tucked her daughter Anne into bed, so that she could work."" The phrase ""so that"" indicates a purpose or intention. It's more logical that Mary would tuck her daughter into bed so that Mary herself could work, rather than tucking her daughter in so the daughter could work.

Additionally, it's typically the parent (in this case, Mary) who would be working after putting a child to bed, not the child working after being put to bed.

Therefore, ""she"" in this context most likely refers to Mary.",0,0
708,"Mary tucked her daughter Anne into bed, so that she could sleep.",she,"0: Mary, 1: Mary's daughter, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Mary is the subject of the main clause, performing the action of tucking her daughter into bed.
2. Anne (Mary's daughter) is the object of the action, being tucked into bed.
3. The purpose of tucking someone into bed is typically to help them sleep.

Given this context, it's more logical that ""she"" refers to Anne (Mary's daughter) rather than Mary. The act of tucking someone into bed is usually done so that the person being tucked in can sleep, not the person doing the tucking.

Therefore, ""she"" in this sentence most likely refers to Anne, Mary's daughter.",1,1
709,"Fred and Alice had very warm down coats, but they were not prepared for the cold in Alaska.",they,"0: Fred and Alice, 1: coats, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" refers to Fred and Alice, not the coats. The sentence is describing Fred and Alice's lack of preparedness for the cold in Alaska, despite having warm coats. The coats are mentioned as an object they possessed, but the main subjects of the sentence are Fred and Alice. The pronoun ""they"" is used to continue referring to these two people in the second part of the sentence.",0,0
710,"Fred and Alice had very warm down coats, but they were not enough for the cold in Alaska.",they,"0: Fred and Alice, 1: coats, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" refers to ""Fred and Alice"" rather than ""coats"" or neither option. The reasoning is as follows:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""they"" is referring to the subjects of the sentence, which are Fred and Alice.
2. The context implies that Fred and Alice were not warm enough despite having warm coats, indicating that ""they"" refers to the people, not the coats.
3. Grammatically, ""they"" is a plural pronoun, which matches with ""Fred and Alice"" (two people) rather than ""coats"" (which would typically use ""it"" if referring to a single coat).
4. The sentence is describing a situation where Fred and Alice experienced cold despite their warm clothing, so ""they"" logically refers to the people experiencing the cold.

Therefore, the pronoun ""they"" most likely refers to candidate 0: Fred and Alice.",1,0
711,Thomson visited Cooper's grave in 1765. At that date he had been travelling for five years.,he,"0: Thomson, 1: Cooper, 2: Neither","To determine who the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The first sentence states that Thomson visited Cooper's grave in 1765.
2. The second sentence mentions that ""he"" had been travelling for five years at that date (1765).

Given this information, we can deduce that ""he"" most likely refers to Thomson for the following reasons:
- Thomson is the active subject of the first sentence, making him the more prominent character.
- The pronoun ""he"" is used in relation to traveling, which is an action more likely associated with the person doing the visiting (Thomson) rather than the deceased person whose grave is being visited (Cooper).
- The use of ""at that date"" connects the second sentence directly to the first, maintaining Thomson as the subject.

It's highly unlikely that ""he"" refers to Cooper, as Cooper is only mentioned in the context of his grave, implying he is already deceased and thus not traveling.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Thomson.",0,"0

712,Thomson visited Cooper's grave in 1765. At that date he had been dead for five years.,he,"0: Thomson, 1: Cooper, 2: Neither","To determine who the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and timeline presented in the text:

1. Thomson visited Cooper's grave in 1765.
2. ""At that date he had been dead for five years.""

The pronoun ""he"" is used in reference to someone who had been dead for five years as of 1765. This means the person being referred to died in 1760.

Given that Thomson is described as visiting Cooper's grave, it's logical to conclude that Cooper is the one who had died. Thomson, being the one doing the visiting, was alive in 1765.

Therefore, ""he"" in this context refers to Cooper, not Thomson.",1,1
713,"Jackson was greatly influenced by Arnold, though he lived two centuries later.",he,"0: Jackson, 1: Arnold, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions two people: Jackson and Arnold.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""though he lived two centuries later.""
3. This clause provides additional information about one of the two people mentioned.
4. The phrase ""two centuries later"" suggests that ""he"" refers to the person who lived more recently.
5. Since Jackson was influenced by Arnold, it's logical that Jackson came after Arnold in time.

Therefore, ""he"" most likely refers to Jackson, as he would have lived two centuries after Arnold.",0,0
714,"Jackson was greatly influenced by Arnold, though he lived two centuries earlier.",he,"0: Jackson, 1: Arnold, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions two people: Jackson and Arnold.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""though he lived two centuries earlier.""
3. The main clause states that ""Jackson was greatly influenced by Arnold.""
4. The subordinate clause introduced by ""though"" provides additional information about one of the people mentioned.

Given this analysis, we can conclude that ""he"" refers to Arnold because:
1. The sentence is primarily about Jackson being influenced by Arnold.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used to provide additional information about someone who lived earlier than the main subject (Jackson).
3. It wouldn't make sense for Jackson to have lived two centuries earlier than Arnold if Arnold influenced Jackson.

Therefore, ""he"" must refer to Arnold, who lived two centuries earlier than Jackson.",1,1
715,I can't cut that tree down with that axe; it is too thick.,it,"0: The tree, 1: The axe, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""it"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions two objects: a tree and an axe.
2. The pronoun ""it"" is used in the clause ""it is too thick.""
3. In this context, ""thick"" is more likely to describe a tree than an axe.
4. The sentence implies that the tree cannot be cut down because of its thickness, not because the axe is thick.

Therefore, the pronoun ""it"" most likely refers to the tree, as it makes more sense in the context of the sentence to describe the tree as being too thick to cut down.",0,0
716,I can't cut that tree down with that axe; it is too small.,it,"0: The tree, 1: The axe, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""it"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence mentions two objects: a tree and an axe.
2. The pronoun ""it"" is used in the clause ""it is too small.""
3. The sentence implies that something is preventing the cutting down of the tree.
4. Logically, a tree being too small would not prevent it from being cut down.
5. However, an axe being too small would make it difficult or impossible to cut down a tree.

Based on this analysis, it's most logical that ""it"" refers to the axe. The sentence is saying that the axe is too small to cut down the tree.",1,1
717,The foxes are getting in at night and attacking the chickens. I shall have to kill them.,them,"0: The foxes, 1: The chickens, 2: Neither","In this context, the pronoun ""them"" most likely refers to ""The foxes"" for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""them"" is the object of the action ""kill"".
2. The foxes are presented as the problem (they are attacking the chickens), so it makes logical sense that the speaker would want to eliminate the threat.
3. It would be counterintuitive for the speaker to kill the chickens, as they are the victims in this scenario.
4. The phrase ""I shall have to kill them"" implies taking action against the cause of the problem, which is the foxes.

Therefore, the pronoun ""them"" most likely refers to ""The foxes"".",0,0
718,The foxes are getting in at night and attacking the chickens. I shall have to guard them.,them,"0: The foxes, 1: The chickens, 2: Neither","In this context, the pronoun ""them"" most likely refers to ""the chickens"" for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure suggests that the speaker is reacting to the problem of foxes attacking chickens.
2. It would make more sense to guard the chickens (the victims) rather than the foxes (the attackers).
3. Guarding the chickens is a logical solution to protect them from fox attacks.
4. It's unlikely that the speaker would want to guard the foxes, as they are the cause of the problem.
5. The pronoun ""them"" is plural, which matches with ""the chickens"" (plural) rather than ""The foxes"" (also plural, but less likely given the context).

Therefore, the most logical referent for ""them"" is ""the chickens"" (candidate 1).",1,1
719,The foxes are getting in at night and attacking the chickens. They have gotten very bold.,They,"0: The foxes, 1: The chickens, 2: Neither","In this context, ""They"" most likely refers to ""The foxes"" for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure and flow suggest that ""They"" is continuing the discussion about the foxes.
2. The phrase ""have gotten very bold"" is more logically applied to the foxes, who are described as the active agents in the previous sentence (getting in at night and attacking).
3. It wouldn't make sense to say the chickens have gotten very bold in this context, as they are described as the victims of the attacks.
4. There's no other plural noun or entity mentioned in the text that ""They"" could refer to besides the foxes.

Therefore, the pronoun ""They"" most likely refers to ""The foxes"".",0,0
720,The foxes are getting in at night and attacking the chickens. They have gotten very nervous.,They,"0: The foxes, 1: The chickens, 2: Neither","In this context, ""They"" most likely refers to ""the chickens"" for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure suggests a cause-and-effect relationship: The foxes are attacking, which is causing a reaction in another group.

2. It's more logical that the chickens would become nervous as a result of being attacked, rather than the foxes becoming nervous while attacking.

3. Chickens are known to be easily frightened animals, especially when faced with predators like foxes.

4. It wouldn't make sense for the foxes to be nervous, as they are described as the aggressors in this situation.

Therefore, ""They"" in ""They have gotten very nervous"" most likely refers to the chickens.",1,1
721,"Fred covered his eyes with his hands, because the wind was blowing sand around. He opened them when the wind stopped.",them,"0: His eyes, 1: His hands, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. The pronoun ""them"" is plural, so it must refer to a plural noun in the sentence.

2. The candidates are ""His eyes"" and ""His hands"", both of which are plural.

3. The context of the sentence is crucial here. The text states that ""Fred covered his eyes with his hands"" and then ""He opened them when the wind stopped.""

4. Logically, what Fred would open when the wind stopped are his eyes, not his hands. 

5. It wouldn't make sense to say he ""opened his hands"" in this context, as hands aren't typically described as being ""opened"" after being used to cover the eyes.

Therefore, the pronoun ""them"" most likely refers to ""His eyes"".",0,0
722,"Fred covered his eyes with his hands, because the wind was blowing sand around. He lowered them when the wind stopped.",them,"0: His eyes, 1: His hands, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. The pronoun ""them"" is plural, so it must refer to a plural noun in the sentence.

2. The candidates are ""His eyes"" and ""His hands"", both of which are plural.

3. The first sentence states that ""Fred covered his eyes with his hands"".

4. The second sentence says ""He lowered them when the wind stopped"".

5. Logically, what Fred would lower when the wind stopped would be his hands, not his eyes.

6. It wouldn't make sense to say he ""lowered his eyes"" in this context, as eyes aren't typically ""lowered"" in the same way hands are.

7. Therefore, ""them"" most likely refers to ""his hands"".

Based on this reasoning, the pronoun ""them"" refers to candidate 1: His hands.",1,1

The context clearly indicates that the actress changed her name from Terpsichore to Tina. The pronoun ""it"" is used in the phrase ""she changed it to Tina,"" where ""it"" stands for her previous name, Terpsichore. The reason given for the change is that she figured ""it"" (Terpsichore) was harder to pronounce, so she opted for an easier name (Tina). Therefore, the pronoun ""it"" refers to the first candidate, Terpsichore.",1,0
725,Fred watched TV while George went out to buy groceries. After an hour he got up.,he,"0: Fred, 1: George, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and the actions described in the text.

1. Fred's action: Watched TV
2. George's action: Went out to buy groceries
3. Pronoun action: ""After an hour he got up""

The pronoun ""he"" is more likely to refer to Fred because:
1. Fred was described as watching TV, which typically involves sitting or lying down.
2. The action ""got up"" implies that the person was previously in a seated or lying position, which aligns with watching TV.
3. George was described as going out, so he was already up and moving around.

Therefore, it makes more sense that ""he"" refers to Fred, who was watching TV and then got up after an hour.",0,0
726,Fred watched TV while George went out to buy groceries. After an hour he got back.,he,"0: Fred, 1: George, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence by sentence:

1. ""Fred watched TV while George went out to buy groceries.""
   - Fred is staying at home watching TV.
   - George is going out to buy groceries.

2. ""After an hour he got back.""
   - The pronoun ""he"" refers to someone who was out and has now returned.
   - The action of ""getting back"" implies that this person had left earlier.

Given this information, we can conclude that ""he"" refers to George, not Fred. George was the one who went out to buy groceries, so he would be the one to ""get back"" after an hour. Fred, on the other hand, was watching TV at home and didn't leave, so he couldn't ""get back.""

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" in this context refers to George.",1,1

1. Fred was supposed to run the dishwasher, but he put it off.
2. He wanted to watch TV instead.
3. The show (on TV) turned out to be boring.
4. He changed his mind and turned ""it"" on.

The pronoun ""it"" in the last sentence refers to the thing that Fred turned on. Given the context, it's clear that Fred initially didn't run the dishwasher because he wanted to watch TV. However, when the TV show was boring, he changed his mind.

The phrase ""changed his mind"" indicates that he went back to his original task, which was running the dishwasher. Therefore, the ""it"" that he turned on must be the dishwasher.",0,0

1. The first ""it"" in the sentence ""he put it off"" refers to running the dishwasher. This is not the ""it"" we're asked about.

2. The second ""it"" appears in the phrase ""turned it off."" This is the pronoun we need to identify.

3. The sentence mentions that ""the show turned out to be boring,"" which implies that Fred was watching TV.

4. The phrase ""he changed his mind and turned it off"" follows directly after mentioning the boring show.

Given this context, it's clear that the ""it"" being turned off is referring to the TV. Fred changed his mind about watching TV because the show was boring, so he turned off the TV.

Therefore, the pronoun ""it"" in this case refers to the TV.",1,1
729,Fred is the only man still alive who remembers my great-grandfather. He is a remarkable man.,He,"0: Fred, 1: My great-grandfather, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""He"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and grammatical structure of the sentences:

1. The first sentence introduces Fred and mentions the great-grandfather.
2. The second sentence starts with ""He,"" which is likely referring to someone just mentioned.
3. The second sentence describes ""He"" as ""a remarkable man.""

Given this information:

- Fred is described as ""still alive,"" which makes him a more likely subject for the second sentence.
- The great-grandfather is implied to be no longer alive, as Fred remembers him.
- The description ""a remarkable man"" is more likely to refer to someone who is still living and can be observed in the present.

Therefore, it is most logical that ""He"" in the second sentence refers to Fred.",0,0
730,Fred is the only man still alive who remembers my great-grandfather. He was a remarkable man.,He,"0: Fred, 1: My great-grandfather, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""He"" is ambiguous and could refer to either Fred or the great-grandfather. However, given the context, it's more likely that ""He"" refers to the great-grandfather for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure suggests a shift in focus from Fred to the great-grandfather. Fred is introduced as someone who remembers the great-grandfather, but then the next sentence seems to provide additional information about a ""remarkable man.""

2. It's more common and natural to describe an older relative (like a great-grandfather) as ""remarkable"" rather than someone who is simply old enough to remember that relative.

3. The use of ""was"" in ""He was a remarkable man"" implies that the person being referred to is no longer alive. We know that Fred is ""still alive,"" so this past tense description is more likely to apply to the great-grandfather.

While there is some ambiguity, the balance of evidence suggests that ""He"" most likely refers to the great-grandfather.",1,1
731,"Fred is the only man alive who still remembers my father as an infant. When Fred first saw my father, he was twelve years old.",he,"0: Fred, 1: My father, 2: Neither","To determine who the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

""When Fred first saw my father, he was twelve years old.""

In this sentence, ""he"" is more likely to refer to Fred for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure suggests that Fred is the subject who is doing the action (seeing), and ""he"" is providing additional information about Fred at the time of this action.

2. It makes more logical sense for Fred to be twelve years old when he first saw the narrator's father as an infant. If ""he"" referred to the father, it would mean the father was twelve years old as an infant, which is not possible.

3. The first sentence establishes Fred as the older person who remembers the narrator's father as an infant, supporting the interpretation that Fred was older (twelve years old) when he first saw the father.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Fred.",0,0
732,"Fred is the only man alive who still remembers my father as an infant. When Fred first saw my father, he was twelve months old.",he,"0: Fred, 1: My father, 2: Neither","To determine who the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence. The sentence states ""When Fred first saw my father, he was twelve months old."" 

There are two key points to consider:
1. The sentence is about Fred seeing the narrator's father.
2. The age mentioned (twelve months old) is more likely to refer to an infant than an adult.

Given that Fred is described as the ""only man alive who still remembers my father as an infant,"" it's logical to conclude that Fred was older when he saw the narrator's father. The age of twelve months (one year) is clearly referring to the narrator's father as an infant.

Therefore, ""he"" in this context refers to ""my father"" (the narrator's father), not Fred.",1,1
733,"In July, Kamtchatka declared war on Yakutsk. Since Yakutsk's army was much better equipped and ten times larger, they were defeated within weeks.",they,"0: Kamchatka, 1: Yakutsk, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence by sentence:

1. ""In July, Kamtchatka declared war on Yakutsk."" - This sets up the conflict between the two entities.

2. ""Since Yakutsk's army was much better equipped and ten times larger, they were defeated within weeks.""

The pronoun ""they"" in this sentence refers to the entity that was defeated. The sentence structure implies that the entity with the better equipped and larger army would be the victor. Therefore, ""they"" must refer to the entity that does not have these advantages, which is Kamtchatka.

Yakutsk is described as having the superior army, so it wouldn't make sense for Yakutsk to be defeated. The pronoun ""they"" thus refers to Kamtchatka, who declared war but was quickly defeated due to Yakutsk's military superiority.",0,0
734,"In July, Kamtchatka declared war on Yakutsk. Since Yakutsk's army was much better equipped and ten times larger, they were victorious within weeks.",they,"0: Kamchatka, 1: Yakutsk, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The first sentence introduces two entities: Kamtchatka and Yakutsk.
2. The second sentence provides more information about Yakutsk's army, stating it was ""much better equipped and ten times larger.""
3. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the phrase ""they were victorious within weeks.""

Given this context, it's clear that ""they"" refers to Yakutsk for the following reasons:
- The sentence immediately before the pronoun is discussing Yakutsk's army.
- The pronoun is used in conjunction with being ""victorious,"" which aligns with the description of Yakutsk having a superior army.
- It wouldn't make sense for ""they"" to refer to Kamtchatka, as Kamtchatka declared war and was likely defeated given the context.

Therefore, the pronoun ""they"" refers to Yakutsk.",1,1
735,Look! There is a minnow swimming right below that duck! It had better get away to safety fast!,It,"0: The minnow, 1: The duck, 2: Neither","Let's analyze the sentence to determine which candidate the pronoun ""It"" refers to:

1. The sentence mentions two entities: a minnow and a duck.
2. The pronoun ""It"" is used in the second sentence: ""It had better get away to safety fast!""
3. The context suggests that something needs to get away to safety.
4. Given that the minnow is swimming below the duck, it's more likely that the minnow is in danger and needs to get to safety.
5. Ducks are generally not in immediate danger from swimming in water, while small fish like minnows often need to escape from predators.

Based on this reasoning, it's most logical that ""It"" refers to the minnow, as the minnow is the one that needs to get away to safety quickly.",0,0
736,Look! There is a shark swimming right below that duck! It had better get away to safety fast!,It,"0: The shark, 1: The duck, 2: Neither","In this context, the pronoun ""It"" most likely refers to the duck. The sentence ""It had better get away to safety fast!"" implies that the subject is in danger and needs to escape. Given that the shark is described as swimming below the duck, it's the duck that is in a potentially dangerous situation and needs to get away to safety. The shark, being the predator in this scenario, wouldn't need to escape for safety reasons.",1,1
737,"Archaeologists have concluded that humans lived in Laputa 20,000 years ago. They hunted for evidence on the river banks.",They,"0: Archaeologists, 1: Prehistoric humans, 2: Neither","The pronoun ""They"" in this context refers to the archaeologists mentioned in the first sentence. The second sentence describes the actions of the archaeologists, who ""hunted for evidence on the river banks."" This activity is consistent with archaeological work, not with prehistoric humans who lived 20,000 years ago. The use of the past tense ""hunted"" also indicates that this is a recent action performed by the archaeologists, not an action of prehistoric humans.",0,0
738,"Archaeologists have concluded that humans lived in Laputa 20,000 years ago. They hunted for deer on the river banks.",They,"0: Archaeologists, 1: Prehistoric humans, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""They"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and logical flow of the text:

1. The first sentence introduces archaeologists and their conclusion about humans living in Laputa 20,000 years ago.
2. The second sentence, which contains the pronoun ""They,"" describes hunting activities on river banks.

Given this context, it's more logical that the pronoun ""They"" refers to the prehistoric humans rather than the archaeologists. The reasons are:

1. The hunting activity described is more likely to be associated with prehistoric humans from 20,000 years ago, not modern archaeologists.
2. The second sentence appears to be providing additional information about the lives of these ancient humans, which is the main subject of the archaeologists' conclusion.
3. It wouldn't make sense for modern archaeologists to be hunting for deer on river banks in the context of their archaeological work.

Therefore, the pronoun ""They"" most likely refers to the prehistoric humans who lived in Laputa 20,000 years ago.",1,"1

739,The scientists are studying three species of fish that have recently been found living in the Indian Ocean. They began two years ago.,They,"0: The scientists, 1: The fish, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""They"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and grammatical structure of the sentences:

1. The first sentence introduces two potential subjects: ""The scientists"" and ""three species of fish"".
2. The second sentence starts with ""They"" and states that this subject ""began two years ago"".
3. Logically, it makes more sense for scientists to begin a study than for fish to begin something.
4. The verb ""began"" is more likely to refer to the act of starting a study, which is an action typically associated with scientists, not fish.
5. Grammatically, ""They"" is also closer to ""The scientists"" in the text, which is often (but not always) an indicator of the pronoun's antecedent.

Based on these points, it is most logical and grammatically consistent for ""They"" to refer to ""The scientists"" rather than ""The fish"" or any other subject.",0,0
740,The scientists are studying three species of fish that have recently been found living in the Indian Ocean. They appeared two years ago.,They,"0: The scientists, 1: The fish, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""They"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and grammatical structure of the sentences.

1. The first sentence introduces two subjects: ""The scientists"" and ""three species of fish"".
2. The second sentence starts with ""They appeared two years ago.""

The pronoun ""They"" is more likely to refer to ""the fish"" for the following reasons:
1. It's more logical that fish species would ""appear"" rather than scientists.
2. The sentence structure suggests that the new information (appearing two years ago) is about the fish, which is the most recently mentioned subject.
3. If ""They"" referred to the scientists, it would be an abrupt change of subject without any clear transition or reason.

Therefore, the pronoun ""They"" most likely refers to ""The fish"" (candidate 1).",1,1
741,"The journalists interviewed the stars of the new movie. They were very persistent, so the interview lasted for a long time.",They,"0: The journalists, 1: The stars, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""They"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and the characteristics described in the sentence.

1. The first sentence introduces two groups: ""the journalists"" and ""the stars of the new movie.""
2. The second sentence uses ""They"" and describes them as ""very persistent,"" which led to a long interview.
3. In the context of interviews, persistence is typically associated with the interviewers (journalists) rather than the interviewees (stars).
4. The fact that the interview lasted for a long time due to their persistence further supports that ""They"" refers to the journalists.

Based on these observations, it is most logical to conclude that ""They"" refers to ""The journalists"" who conducted the interview persistently.",0,0
742,"The journalists interviewed the stars of the new movie. They were very cooperative, so the interview lasted for a long time.",They,"0: The journalists, 1: The stars, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""They"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and meaning of the sentences:

1. The first sentence introduces two groups: ""the journalists"" and ""the stars of the new movie.""
2. The second sentence uses ""They"" and describes them as ""very cooperative,"" which led to a long interview.

Given this information, it's more likely that ""They"" refers to ""the stars of the new movie"" for the following reasons:

1. It's more common for interviewees (the stars) to be described as cooperative rather than the interviewers (the journalists).
2. The cooperation of the stars would be a more logical reason for the interview lasting a long time, as they would be providing detailed answers and engaging in the conversation.
3. In journalistic contexts, it's typically the interviewees who determine the length of the interview through their willingness to talk and provide information.

Therefore, the pronoun ""They"" most likely refers to ""The stars"" (candidate 1).",1,1
743,The police arrested all of the gang members. They were trying to stop the drug trade in the neighborhood.,They,"0: The police, 1: The gang members, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""They"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and logical flow of the sentences:

1. The first sentence introduces two groups: the police and the gang members.
2. The second sentence uses ""They"" and describes an action: ""trying to stop the drug trade in the neighborhood.""

Logically, it makes more sense for the police to be trying to stop the drug trade, as this aligns with their typical role and responsibilities. Gang members are usually associated with participating in illegal activities like the drug trade, not trying to stop it.

Therefore, ""They"" most likely refers to ""The police"" in this context.",0,0
744,The police arrested all of the gang members. They were trying to run the drug trade in the neighborhood.,They,"0: The police, 1: The gang members, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""They"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and meaning of the sentences:

1. The first sentence states that ""The police arrested all of the gang members.""
2. The second sentence says ""They were trying to run the drug trade in the neighborhood.""

Given this context, it's more logical that the gang members, not the police, were trying to run the drug trade in the neighborhood. The police's role is typically to prevent and stop such illegal activities, not engage in them.

Therefore, ""They"" most likely refers to ""The gang members"" rather than ""The police"" or any other group not mentioned in the text.",1,1

1. The pronoun ""It"" is used in the second sentence: ""It has a lot of butter in it.""

2. We need to determine what ""It"" refers to: the cake or the refrigerator.

3. The statement ""has a lot of butter in it"" is more likely to describe a food item rather than an appliance.

4. Cakes typically contain butter as an ingredient, while refrigerators do not contain butter as a component.

5. Therefore, it's logical to conclude that ""It"" refers to the cake, not the refrigerator.

Based on this reasoning, the pronoun ""It"" most likely refers to the cake.",0,0
746,I put the cake away in the refrigerator. It has a lot of leftovers in it.,It,"0: The cake, 1: The refrigerator, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this step by step:

1. The pronoun ""It"" is used in the second sentence: ""It has a lot of leftovers in it.""

2. We need to determine whether ""It"" refers to the cake, the refrigerator, or neither.

3. The sentence is describing something that contains leftovers.

4. A cake typically doesn't contain leftovers; it is a single food item.

5. A refrigerator, on the other hand, is a storage appliance that commonly contains various food items, including leftovers.

6. The phrase ""has a lot of leftovers in it"" makes more sense when referring to a refrigerator rather than a cake.

Therefore, based on the context and logical reasoning, ""It"" most likely refers to the refrigerator.",1,1
747,Sam broke both his ankles and he's walking with crutches. But a month or so from now they should be better.,they,"0: The ankles, 1: The crutches, 2: Neither","The pronoun ""they"" in this context refers to Sam's ankles. The sentence mentions that Sam broke both his ankles, and then states that ""they should be better"" in a month or so. It's logical that the ankles, which were injured, are expected to heal and get better over time. The crutches are not something that would ""get better,"" as they are tools used for assistance during recovery. Therefore, ""they"" must be referring to the ankles.",0,0
748,Sam broke both his ankles and he's walking with crutches. But a month or so from now they should be unnecessary.,they,"0: The ankles, 1: The crutches, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. The pronoun ""they"" is plural, so it must refer to a plural noun in the sentence.
2. There are two potential plural nouns in the sentence: ""ankles"" and ""crutches"".
3. The sentence states that ""they should be unnecessary"" in a month or so.
4. Logically, the ankles will not become unnecessary. Ankles are a permanent part of the body.
5. However, crutches are temporary aids used for mobility when someone has an injury.
6. The context suggests that as Sam's ankles heal, the crutches will become unnecessary.

Therefore, ""they"" most likely refers to the crutches.",1,1
749,"When the sponsors of the bill got to the town hall, they were surprised to find that the room was full of opponents. They were very much in the minority.",They,"0: The sponsors, 1: The opponents, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""They"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The first sentence introduces two groups: ""the sponsors of the bill"" and ""opponents"".
2. The second sentence starts with ""They were very much in the minority.""

Given this information, we can deduce that ""They"" refers to ""the sponsors of the bill"" for the following reasons:

1. The sponsors are the main subject of the first sentence, making them a more likely antecedent for the pronoun.
2. The sentence states that ""They were very much in the minority."" This logically applies to the sponsors, as they were surprised to find the room full of opponents. If the room was full of opponents, it implies that the sponsors were outnumbered, thus being in the minority.

Therefore, ""They"" most likely refers to ""The sponsors"" (candidate 0).",0,0
750,"When the sponsors of the bill got to the town hall, they were surprised to find that the room was full of opponents. They were very much in the majority.",They,"0: The sponsors, 1: The opponents, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""They"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The first sentence introduces two groups: ""the sponsors of the bill"" and ""opponents"".

Given this information, we can deduce that ""They"" refers to the opponents for the following reasons:
1. The sentence structure suggests that ""They"" is referring to the most recently mentioned group, which is the opponents.
2. The phrase ""very much in the majority"" implies a larger group, which aligns with the description of the room being ""full of opponents"".
3. It wouldn't make sense for the sponsors to be surprised by their own majority presence.

Therefore, the pronoun ""They"" most likely refers to the opponents.",1,1

Next time, we should make more of them.",them,"0: The oatmeal cookies, 1: The chocolate chip cookies, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""them"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and meaning of the sentences:

1. The first sentence states that ""Everyone really loved the oatmeal cookies"" while ""only a few people liked the chocolate chip cookies.""
2. The second sentence suggests making more of ""them"" next time.

Given this information, it's logical to conclude that ""them"" refers to the oatmeal cookies because:
a) They were more popular (loved by everyone).
b) It makes sense to make more of the popular item in the future.

The pronoun ""them"" is plural, which matches both cookie types, but the context strongly suggests it's referring to the oatmeal cookies.",0,0

Next time, we should make fewer of them.",them,"0: The oatmeal cookies, 1: The chocolate chip cookies, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""them"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and logic of the sentence:

1. The first part of the text states that ""Everyone really loved the oatmeal cookies.""
2. The second part mentions that ""only a few people liked the chocolate chip cookies.""
3. The last sentence says, ""Next time, we should make fewer of them.""

Given this information, it's logical to conclude that ""them"" refers to the cookies that were less popular and should be made in smaller quantities next time. This would be the chocolate chip cookies, not the oatmeal cookies that everyone loved.

Therefore, ""them"" most likely refers to the chocolate chip cookies.",1,1
753,"We had hoped to place copies of our newsletter on all the chairs in the auditorium, but there were simply not enough of them.",them,"0: copies of the newsletter, 1: chairs, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""them"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence mentions two plural nouns: ""copies of our newsletter"" and ""chairs"".
2. The pronoun ""them"" is used at the end of the sentence in the phrase ""not enough of them"".
3. The sentence structure suggests that something was lacking in quantity.
4. Logically, the sentence implies that there were not enough chairs to place copies of the newsletter on each one.

Given this analysis, ""them"" most likely refers to ""chairs"" because:
- The sentence is about the inability to place newsletters on all chairs due to a shortage.
- It makes more sense in the context that there were not enough chairs, rather than not enough copies of the newsletter.
- If there were not enough newsletters, the sentence would likely be structured differently.

Therefore, the pronoun ""them"" refers to candidate 1: chairs.",0,1
754,"We had hoped to place copies of our newsletter on all the chairs in the auditorium, but there were simply too many of them.",them,"0: copies of the newsletter, 1: chairs, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""them"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence mentions two potential plural nouns: ""copies of our newsletter"" and ""chairs"".
2. The pronoun ""them"" is used at the end of the sentence in the phrase ""too many of them"".
3. Logically, the sentence is expressing that there were too many of something to place the newsletters on all of them.
4. It wouldn't make sense to say there were too many copies of the newsletter to place the newsletters on the chairs.
5. It does make sense to say there were too many chairs to place newsletters on all of them.

1. The first sentence states: ""I stuck a pin through a carrot.""
2. The second sentence says: ""When I pulled the pin out, it left a hole.""

The pronoun ""it"" in the second sentence is referring to the subject that left a hole. Logically, when you pull a pin out of something, it's the pin that creates or leaves a hole in the object it was stuck into. The carrot doesn't leave a hole; rather, it's the object that receives the hole.

Therefore, ""it"" in this context refers to the pin, not the carrot.",0,0
756,"I stuck a pin through a carrot. When I pulled the pin out, it had a hole.",it,"0: The pin, 1: The carrot, 2: Neither","Let's analyze the sentence:
""I stuck a pin through a carrot. When I pulled the pin out, it had a hole.""

The pronoun ""it"" in this sentence refers to the carrot, not the pin. Here's why:

1. The action described is sticking a pin through a carrot and then pulling the pin out.
2. Logically, after this action, the carrot would be the object that has a hole.
3. A pin, by its nature, doesn't typically get a hole from being stuck through something.
4. The sentence structure suggests that ""it"" refers to the object that was affected by the action (being pierced), which is the carrot.

Therefore, ""it"" in this context refers to the carrot, which is candidate 1.",1,1

1. The sentence mentions two main objects: a pen and coffee.
2. The pronoun ""it"" appears in the phrase ""it got full of coffee.""
3. Logically, the pen is the object that would get full of coffee when used to stir, not the coffee itself.
4. The coffee cannot get ""full of coffee"" as it is already coffee.

Therefore, ""it"" most likely refers to the pen, which got full of coffee when used as a stirrer.",0,0

""I couldn't find a spoon, so I tried using a pen to stir my coffee. But that turned out to be a bad idea, because it got full of ink.""

The pronoun ""it"" in this context refers to something that ""got full of ink."" Given the two candidates:

0: The pen
1: The coffee

It's more logical that the coffee would get full of ink rather than the pen. A pen already contains ink, so it wouldn't make sense to say it ""got full of ink."" On the other hand, stirring coffee with an ink pen could result in the coffee becoming contaminated with ink.

Therefore, the pronoun ""it"" most likely refers to the coffee.",1,1

1. The first sentence establishes that Steve follows Fred's example in everything.
2. The second sentence states that ""He admires him hugely.""

Given this information, it's more logical that Steve is the one who admires Fred, rather than Fred admiring himself. This is because:

a) Steve is the subject of the first sentence, following Fred's example.
b) The admiration in the second sentence aligns with the idea of following someone's example.
c) It's more natural for the person following an example to admire the person they're following, rather than the other way around.

1. The first sentence states that ""Steve follows Fred's example in everything.""
2. The second sentence says ""He influences him hugely.""

Given this information, it's more logical that Fred is the one influencing Steve, rather than the other way around. This is because:

a) Steve is described as following Fred's example, which implies Fred is the influencer.
b) The pronoun ""He"" is used at the beginning of the second sentence, which often refers to the last mentioned person in the previous sentence (Fred in this case).
c) The sentence structure ""He influences him"" suggests that the ""He"" is acting upon the ""him,"" which aligns with Fred influencing Steve.

2. The pronoun ""it"" is used in the clause ""because it is too wide.""
3. The attribute ""too wide"" is more likely to describe the table rather than the doorway.
4. If the doorway were too wide, it wouldn't prevent the table from fitting through.
5. Logically, it's the table's width that's preventing it from fitting through the doorway.

1. The sentence is about the table not fitting through the doorway.
2. The pronoun ""it"" is used in the clause ""because it is too narrow.""
3. Logically, the narrowness is the reason why the table won't fit.
4. Between a table and a doorway, it makes more sense for a doorway to be described as ""narrow"" in this context.
5. If the table were too narrow, it would fit through the doorway easily.

Therefore, ""it"" most likely refers to the doorway, as the narrowness of the doorway is preventing the table from fitting through.",1,1

1. John is the subject of the sentence, performing the action of hiring.
2. Bill is the object of the hiring action.
3. The pronoun ""him"" is used in the phrase ""take care of him.""

Given this structure, it's more likely that ""him"" refers to John rather than Bill. The sentence implies that John hired Bill for the purpose of taking care of someone, and that someone is most likely John himself. It wouldn't make sense for John to hire Bill to take care of Bill.

Therefore, the pronoun ""him"" most likely refers to John.",0,0
766,John hired himself out to Bill to take care of him.,him,"0: John, 1: Bill, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""him"" refers to, let's analyze the sentence:

3. Bill is the person John is hired out to.
4. The pronoun ""him"" comes at the end of the sentence in the phrase ""to take care of him.""

Given this structure, it's most logical that ""him"" refers to Bill. John is hiring himself out to Bill for the purpose of taking care of Bill. It wouldn't make sense for John to hire himself out to Bill to take care of John.

767,"John promised Bill to leave, so an hour later he left.",he,"0: John, 1: Bill, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and the logical flow of the sentence:

1. The sentence states that ""John promised Bill to leave.""
2. This implies that John made a promise about his own action (leaving).
3. The sentence then continues with ""so an hour later he left.""
4. The use of ""so"" indicates a consequence or result of the previous action (the promise).
5. Since John was the one who made the promise to leave, it's most logical that he would be the one to fulfill that promise.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to John, as he was the subject of the promise and the one expected to carry out the action of leaving.",0,0
768,"John ordered Bill to leave, so an hour later he left.",he,"0: John, 1: Bill, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and logical flow of the sentence:

1. John ordered Bill to leave.
2. An hour later, ""he"" left.

The pronoun ""he"" is more likely to refer to Bill for the following reasons:

1. Bill was the one who was ordered to leave, so it makes sense that he would be the one to actually leave.
2. The sentence structure implies a cause-and-effect relationship: John's order (cause) resulted in someone leaving (effect).
3. If ""he"" referred to John, it would be unclear why John would leave an hour later, as he was not the one ordered to do so.

Therefore, the most logical interpretation is that Bill (candidate 1) is the one who left an hour later, following John's order.",1,1

2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in relation to facing difficulties in research.
3. It's more likely that the author (Goodman) faced difficulties in researching for the biography, rather than the subject of the biography (Xenophanes) facing difficulties.
4. The phrase ""difficulties he faced in his research"" strongly suggests that it refers to the person doing the research, which is the biographer, Sam Goodman.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Sam Goodman.",0,0
770,Sam Goodman's biography of the Spartan general Xenophanes conveys a vivid sense of the difficulties he faced in his childhood.,he,"0: Goodman, 1: Xenophanes, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence is about Sam Goodman's biography of Xenophanes.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in reference to someone's childhood difficulties.
3. It's more likely that a biography would discuss the childhood of its subject (Xenophanes) rather than the author's (Goodman's) childhood.
4. The phrase ""difficulties he faced in his childhood"" suggests we're talking about the subject of the biography, not the author.

Based on these points, it's clear that ""he"" refers to Xenophanes, the subject of the biography, rather than Sam Goodman, the author.",1,1
771,"Emma's mother had died long ago, and her education had been managed by an excellent woman as governess.",her,"0: Emma, 1: Emma's mother, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine whether the pronoun ""her"" refers to Emma or Emma's mother. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence starts by mentioning ""Emma's mother.""
2. It then states that ""her education had been managed...""

Given this information, it's more logical that the pronoun ""her"" refers to Emma rather than her mother. This is because:

1. The sentence is primarily about Emma, as indicated by the possessive ""Emma's"" at the beginning.
2. It wouldn't make sense to talk about the education of Emma's mother in this context, especially since it's mentioned that the mother ""had died long ago.""
3. The use of ""had been managed"" suggests an ongoing process in the past, which aligns more with Emma's education rather than her deceased mother's.

Therefore, the pronoun ""her"" most likely refers to Emma.",0,0
772,"Emma's mother had died long ago, and her place had been taken by an excellent woman as governess.",her,"0: Emma, 1: Emma's mother, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which candidate the pronoun ""her"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence mentions Emma's mother had died long ago.
2. It then states that ""her place had been taken by an excellent woman as governess.""

The pronoun ""her"" in this context is referring to the person whose place was taken by the governess. Since Emma's mother had died, it makes sense that her role or place in Emma's life was filled by the governess.

Therefore, ""her"" in this sentence is referring to Emma's mother, not Emma herself.",1,1
773,Jane knocked on Susan's door but she did not get an answer.,she,"0: Jane, 1: Susan, 2: Neither","To determine who ""she"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and the most logical interpretation:

1. Jane is the subject of the first part of the sentence, performing the action of knocking on Susan's door.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the second part of the sentence, which describes not getting an answer.
3. It's more logical that Jane, who knocked on the door, would be the one not getting an answer.
4. If ""she"" referred to Susan, it would imply that Susan did not answer herself, which doesn't make sense in this context.

Therefore, the most reasonable interpretation is that ""she"" refers to Jane, who knocked on the door and did not receive an answer from Susan.",0,0
774,Jane knocked on Susan's door but she did not answer.,she,"0: Jane, 1: Susan, 2: Neither","To determine who ""she"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context:

1. Jane is the subject of the first clause, performing the action of knocking on Susan's door.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the second clause, stating that ""she did not answer.""
3. Logically, the person who would be expected to answer the door is Susan, since it's her door that Jane is knocking on.
4. The use of ""but"" suggests a contrast between the action of knocking and the lack of answer, implying that the person not answering (referred to as ""she"") is different from the person knocking.

Given these points, it's most likely that ""she"" refers to Susan, as Susan would be the one expected to answer her own door when someone knocks.",1,1
775,Joe paid the detective after he received the final report on the case.,he,"0: Joe, 1: the detective, 2: Neither","To determine who ""he"" refers to in this sentence, we need to consider the context and logical sequence of events:

1. The sentence describes a payment transaction between Joe and the detective.
2. The payment occurs ""after he received the final report on the case.""
3. In a typical detective-client relationship, the client (in this case, Joe) would receive the final report from the detective.
4. It makes more sense that Joe would pay the detective after receiving the report, rather than the detective paying himself.

Given this reasoning, ""he"" most likely refers to Joe, as he would be the one receiving the final report and then paying the detective for their services.",0,0
776,Joe paid the detective after he delivered the final report on the case.,he,"0: Joe, 1: the detective, 2: Neither","To determine who ""he"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and the logical flow of events:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" is the subject of the second action (delivering the final report).
2. It's more logical that the detective would deliver the final report on the case, as that's typically part of a detective's job.
3. The payment by Joe comes after the report is delivered, which aligns with the usual order of events in hiring a detective.
4. It wouldn't make sense for Joe to deliver the final report to himself.

777,"Beth didn't get angry with Sally, who had cut her off, because she stopped and counted to ten.",she,"0: Beth, 1: Sally, 2: Neither","To determine who ""she"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and the actions described:

1. Beth didn't get angry with Sally.
2. Sally had cut Beth off.
3. ""She"" stopped and counted to ten.

The pronoun ""she"" is most likely referring to Beth because:

1. The sentence is primarily about Beth's reaction to Sally's action.
2. The act of stopping and counting to ten is a common anger management technique.
3. This action (stopping and counting) is presented as the reason why Beth didn't get angry, despite Sally cutting her off.

It wouldn't make sense for ""she"" to refer to Sally in this context, as Sally's action (cutting Beth off) has already been described, and the sentence is focusing on Beth's response to that action.

Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Beth.",0,0
778,"Beth didn't get angry with Sally, who had cut her off, because she stopped and apologized.",she,"0: Beth, 1: Sally, 2: Neither","To determine who ""she"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and the actions described:

1. Beth didn't get angry with Sally.
2. Sally had cut Beth off.
3. Someone stopped and apologized.

The pronoun ""she"" is used in the phrase ""she stopped and apologized."" This action is the reason why Beth didn't get angry with Sally. It's logical to conclude that Sally is the one who stopped and apologized after cutting Beth off. If Beth had stopped and apologized, there would be no reason for her to be angry in the first place.

Therefore, ""she"" in this context refers to Sally.",1,1
779,Jim signaled the barman and gestured toward his empty glass,his,"0: Jim, 1: The barman, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""his"" most likely refers to Jim for the following reasons:

1. Jim is the subject of the sentence and the main actor performing the actions (signaling and gesturing).
2. The empty glass is more likely to belong to Jim, as he is the customer in this scenario.
3. It's common for customers to signal barmen for refills or to indicate their empty glasses.
4. The barman is mentioned as the recipient of Jim's signal, not as the owner of the empty glass.

The sentence structure and context strongly suggest that ""his"" refers to Jim's empty glass, not the barman's.",0,0
780,Jim signaled the barman and gestured toward his bathroom key.,his,"0: Jim, 1: The barman, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""his"" most likely refers to Jim for the following reasons:

1. Jim is the subject of the sentence and the main actor performing the actions (signaling and gesturing).
2. The sentence structure suggests that Jim is making a request or indicating something about his own possession (the bathroom key).
3. It's more common for a customer (Jim) to have a bathroom key in a bar setting, rather than the barman having a personal bathroom key while working.
4. The flow of the sentence implies that Jim is gesturing towards his own key, possibly to request access to the bathroom or to return the key.

While it's not impossible for ""his"" to refer to the barman, the context and sentence structure make it much more likely that the pronoun refers to Jim.",1,0
781,"Dan took the rear seat while Bill claimed the front because his ""Dibs!"" was slow.",his,"0: Dan, 1: Bill, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""his"" refers to. The context suggests that the pronoun ""his"" is associated with the person who was slow in calling ""Dibs!"" for the front seat. 

The sentence structure implies that Bill claimed the front seat, while Dan took the rear seat. The reason given for this arrangement is that ""his 'Dibs!' was slow."" This indicates that someone tried to call ""Dibs!"" on the front seat but wasn't quick enough.

Since Bill ended up in the front seat, it's logical to conclude that Dan was the one who was slow in calling ""Dibs!"" Therefore, ""his"" most likely refers to Dan.",0,0
782,"Dan took the rear seat while Bill claimed the front because his ""Dibs!"" was quicker.",his,"0: Dan, 1: Bill, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""his"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence describes a situation where Dan and Bill are taking seats in a vehicle.
2. Dan takes the rear seat, while Bill claims the front seat.
3. The reason given for Bill getting the front seat is that ""his 'Dibs!' was quicker.""

The pronoun ""his"" is directly connected to the action of calling ""Dibs!"" quickly. This action is what allowed the person to claim the front seat. Since we know that Bill claimed the front seat, it logically follows that ""his"" refers to Bill.

The sentence structure also supports this conclusion, as ""Bill"" is the subject of the clause containing ""his,"" making it the most recent and relevant antecedent for the pronoun.

Therefore, the pronoun ""his"" most likely refers to Bill.",1,1
783,"Tom said ""Check"" to Ralph as he moved his bishop.",his,"0: Tom, 1: Ralph, 2: Neither","To determine who ""his"" refers to in this sentence, we need to consider the context and the most logical interpretation:

1. The sentence describes a chess game scenario.
2. Tom is the subject of the sentence and the one who said ""Check.""
3. ""He moved his bishop"" is part of the same action sequence.
4. In chess, saying ""Check"" typically occurs when a player moves their own piece to threaten the opponent's king.

Given these points, it's most logical that Tom is the one who moved the bishop. The pronoun ""his"" is more likely to refer to Tom because:

a) Tom is the active subject of the sentence.
b) The action of saying ""Check"" and moving the bishop are connected.
c) It would be unusual for Tom to announce ""Check"" if Ralph had moved a piece.

Therefore, ""his"" most likely refers to Tom.",0,0
784,"Tom said ""Check"" to Ralph as he took his bishop.",his,"0: Tom, 1: Ralph, 2: Neither","To determine who ""his"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context:

1. The sentence describes a chess game between Tom and Ralph.
2. Tom says ""Check"" to Ralph.
3. The pronoun ""he"" is used to describe the person who took the bishop.
4. In chess, saying ""Check"" typically means you're threatening the opponent's king.
5. Taking a bishop is an offensive move, which aligns with the person who said ""Check.""

Given this analysis, it's more likely that Tom is the one who took the bishop. The sentence structure suggests that Tom is the active player in this scenario - he's the one speaking and likely the one making the move. Therefore, ""his"" most probably refers to Ralph's bishop that Tom captured.",1,1
785,"As Andrea in the crop duster passed over Susan, she could see the landing strip.",she,"0: Andrea, 1: Susan, 2: Neither","To determine who ""she"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and the logical flow of the action.

1. Andrea is in the crop duster, which is an airplane.
2. The crop duster is passing over Susan.
3. ""She"" can see the landing strip.

Given this information, it's most logical that ""she"" refers to Andrea for the following reasons:
1. Andrea is the one in the aircraft, which gives her a better vantage point to see the landing strip.
2. The action of seeing the landing strip is more likely to be performed by the person in the aircraft, as they would be looking for a place to land.
3. Susan is on the ground being passed over, which makes it less likely for her to be able to see the landing strip, especially if the crop duster is between her and the landing strip.

1. Andrea is in the crop duster (airplane).
2. The crop duster is passing over Susan.
3. ""She"" could see the landing gear.

Given this information, it's more likely that ""she"" refers to Susan for the following reasons:
1. Susan is on the ground, in a position to look up at the airplane.
2. The landing gear would be visible from below the airplane, not from inside it.
3. Andrea, being inside the crop duster, would not typically be looking at the landing gear while flying.

Therefore, it makes more sense that Susan, who is on the ground, would be able to see the landing gear of the crop duster as it passes over her.",1,1
787,Tom gave Ralph a lift to school so he wouldn't have to drive alone.,he,"0: Tom, 1: Ralph, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence:

1. ""Tom gave Ralph a lift to school"" - This indicates that Tom was driving and giving Ralph a ride.
2. ""so he wouldn't have to drive alone"" - This part refers to the person who would be driving if Tom hadn't given Ralph a lift.

The pronoun ""he"" in this context refers to Tom, because:
- If Tom hadn't given Ralph a lift, Tom would have been the one driving alone.
- The sentence implies that by giving Ralph a lift, Tom avoided driving alone.
- It wouldn't make sense for ""he"" to refer to Ralph, as Ralph wasn't going to drive in this scenario (he was getting a lift from Tom).

Therefore, ""he"" most likely refers to Tom.",0,0
788,Tom gave Ralph a lift to school so he wouldn't have to walk.,he,"0: Tom, 1: Ralph, 2: Neither","To determine who ""he"" refers to in this sentence, we need to consider the context and logical flow:

2. Ralph is the recipient of the action (receiving the lift).
3. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""so he wouldn't have to walk.""

Given this information, it's more logical that ""he"" refers to Ralph for the following reasons:
- The purpose of giving a lift is typically to help someone avoid walking.
- Tom, being the one giving the lift, is already in a vehicle and wouldn't need to walk anyway.
- Ralph, as the recipient of the lift, is the one benefiting from not having to walk.

789,Bill passed the half-empty plate to John because he was full.,he,"0: Bill, 1: John, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. Bill passed the half-empty plate to John.
2. The reason given is ""because he was full.""

The pronoun ""he"" is most likely referring to Bill for the following reasons:
1. Bill is the one passing the plate, which suggests he's finished eating.
2. The plate is described as ""half-empty,"" implying that someone has already eaten from it.
3. The action of passing the plate is explained by the person being full.

It makes more logical sense that Bill, who is passing the plate, is the one who is full. If John were full, he wouldn't be receiving the plate from Bill.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Bill.",0,0
790,Bill passed the half-empty plate to John because he was hungry.,he,"0: Bill, 1: John, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. Bill passed the half-empty plate to John.
2. The reason given is ""because he was hungry.""

The pronoun ""he"" is more likely to refer to John in this context for the following reasons:

1. The action of passing a plate is typically done to give food to someone who is hungry.
2. If Bill were hungry, he would be more likely to keep the plate for himself rather than pass it to John.
3. The fact that the plate is described as ""half-empty"" suggests that Bill has already eaten some of the food, making it less likely that he is still hungry.

Therefore, the most logical interpretation is that John is the hungry one, and Bill is passing him the plate with the remaining food.",1,1
791,Bill passed the gameboy to John because his turn was over.,his,"0: Bill, 1: John, 2: Neither","To determine whose turn was over, we need to consider the context of the sentence. The pronoun ""his"" refers to the person whose turn has ended, which is the reason for passing the gameboy.

In this case, Bill is the one passing the gameboy to John. The act of passing the gameboy suggests that Bill's turn has finished, and he is now giving John a chance to play. This interpretation aligns with the common practice in turn-based games where players hand over the device or controller when their turn is complete.

Therefore, ""his"" most likely refers to Bill, as it is Bill's turn that is over, prompting him to pass the gameboy to John.",0,0
792,Bill passed the gameboy to John because his turn was next.,his,"0: Bill, 1: John, 2: Neither","To determine who ""his"" refers to in this sentence, we need to consider the context and logical flow of the action described.

1. Bill is passing the gameboy to John.
2. The reason for passing the gameboy is stated: ""because his turn was next.""

The pronoun ""his"" is more likely to refer to John for the following reasons:
1. It makes more sense that John's turn would be next, as he is receiving the gameboy.
2. If it were Bill's turn, he would likely keep the gameboy rather than passing it to John.
3. The act of passing the gameboy implies that it's time for the other person (John) to have a turn.

Therefore, the most logical conclusion is that ""his"" refers to John, as it's John's turn that is next, which is why Bill is passing the gameboy to him.",1,1

3. Logically, the shoulders belong to the person doing the lifting, which is ""the man"".

1. The sentence describes an action where ""the man"" is lifting ""the boy"" onto a bunk bed.
2. The pronoun ""his"" is used to indicate ownership or possession of the bunk bed.
3. It's more likely that the bunk bed belongs to the boy rather than the man, as bunk beds are typically associated with children's rooms.
4. Additionally, the action of lifting the boy onto the bed suggests that it's the boy's bed, as it would be unusual for a man to lift a boy onto his own (the man's) bed.

Given these considerations, it's most logical to conclude that ""his"" refers to ""the boy"" in this context.",1,1
795,"Stretching her back, the woman smiled at the girl.",her,"0: The woman, 1: The girl, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""her"" refers to ""the woman"" for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure indicates that ""her"" is part of the phrase ""Stretching her back,"" which is a participial phrase modifying the subject ""the woman.""

2. The action of stretching one's back is typically performed by the person themselves, not by someone else.

3. The woman is the main subject of the sentence, performing both the actions of stretching and smiling.

4. The girl is mentioned as the object of the woman's smile, not as the one performing any action.

Therefore, it is clear that ""her"" refers to ""the woman"" in this context.",0,0
796,"Patting her back, the woman smiled at the girl.",her,"0: The woman, 1: The girl, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""her"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence describes two actions: patting and smiling.
2. ""The woman"" is the subject performing both actions.
3. ""The girl"" is the recipient of the woman's smile.
4. The phrase ""Patting her back"" comes first in the sentence, indicating it's happening simultaneously or just before the smiling action.

Given this information, it's most logical that ""her"" refers to ""the girl"" for the following reasons:
1. It's more natural for the woman to be patting the girl's back while smiling at her.
2. If ""her"" referred to the woman, it would imply the woman was patting her own back, which is less likely in this context.

Therefore, ""her"" most likely refers to ""the girl"" in this sentence.",1,1

2. The sentence describes Billy crying, which suggests he's the main focus.
3. The pronoun ""his"" is used in relation to the toy.
4. It's more logical that Billy would be crying because Toby wouldn't accept Billy's toy, rather than Toby's own toy.

Given these points, it's most likely that ""his"" refers to Billy. The toy belongs to Billy, and he's upset because Toby won't accept it.",0,0

2. It's more logical that Toby wouldn't share his own toy rather than Billy's toy.
3. The pronoun ""his"" is closer to ""Toby"" in the sentence, which often indicates a stronger connection.
4. The fact that Billy is crying implies that he wants something he doesn't have, which is likely Toby's toy.

Based on these points, it's most probable that ""his"" refers to Toby's toy, not Billy's.",1,1

1. The sentence mentions two people: Lily and Donna.
2. The action described is ""Lily spoke to Donna.""
3. The phrase ""breaking her silence"" follows this action.

Given this information, we can deduce that ""her"" most likely refers to Lily for the following reasons:
1. Lily is the subject of the sentence and the one performing the action (speaking).
2. The phrase ""breaking her silence"" implies that the person was previously silent and is now speaking.
3. Since Lily is the one speaking, it makes more sense that she would be breaking her own silence rather than Donna's.

Therefore, the pronoun ""her"" most likely refers to Lily.",0,0
800,"Lily spoke to Donna, breaking her concentration.",her,"0: Lily, 1: Donna, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""her"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence describes an action (speaking) performed by Lily towards Donna.
2. The pronoun ""her"" is used in the phrase ""breaking her concentration.""
3. Logically, the person whose concentration was broken would be the one being spoken to, not the one doing the speaking.

1. Tommy dropped his ice cream.
2. Timmy giggled in response to Tommy's misfortune.
3. Father gave ""him"" a sympathetic look.

Given the context, it's most logical that the father would give a sympathetic look to Tommy, who had just dropped his ice cream. Timmy, who giggled at Tommy's misfortune, would be less likely to receive sympathy.

The pronoun ""him"" in this case most likely refers to Tommy, as he's the one who experienced the unfortunate event and would be the natural recipient of sympathy.",0,0

1. Tommy dropped his ice cream.
2. Timmy giggled in response to Tommy dropping his ice cream.
3. Father gave ""him"" a stern look.

The pronoun ""him"" is most likely referring to Timmy for the following reasons:
- Tommy dropping his ice cream is not an action that would typically warrant a stern look from a father.
- Timmy giggling at someone else's misfortune (Tommy dropping his ice cream) is behavior that a parent might want to discourage.
- The sequence of events suggests that the father's stern look is a reaction to Timmy's giggling, not to Tommy's accident.

Therefore, it's most logical that ""him"" refers to Timmy, as he's the one who exhibited behavior that might prompt a stern look from a parent.",1,1

Given this information, it's more likely that Ollie's legs are aching because:

a) Ollie is the one doing the physical action of carrying Tommy.
b) Climbing steps while carrying someone would be more strenuous and likely to cause leg ache.
c) Tommy is being carried, so his legs are not actively engaged in the climbing action.

2. Possessive context: The use of ""her chest"" implies ownership, and it's more natural to interpret this as referring to the woman's own chest rather than the girl's.

3. Logical interpretation: It's more common and logical for an adult (the woman) to hold a child (the girl) against her (the woman's) chest, rather than the other way around.

4. Proximity: While ""her"" is closer to ""the girl"" in the sentence, the overall context and meaning suggest it refers back to ""the woman"".

Therefore, the pronoun ""her"" most likely refers to ""The woman"" (candidate 0).",0,0
808,The woman held the girl against her will.,her,"0: The woman, 1: The girl, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""her"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence is: ""The woman held the girl against her will.""
2. The pronoun ""her"" is used in the phrase ""against her will.""
3. In this context, ""her will"" refers to the person who is being held against their wishes.
4. The subject of the sentence is ""The woman,"" who is performing the action of holding.
5. The object of the sentence is ""the girl,"" who is being held.
6. Logically, it makes more sense that the girl is being held against her own will, rather than the woman holding the girl against the woman's will.

Therefore, the pronoun ""her"" most likely refers to ""the girl"" in this sentence.",1,1
809,"Pam's parents came home and found her having sex with her boyfriend, Paul. They were furious about it.",They,"0: Pam's parents, 1: Pam and Paul, 2: Neither","To determine who ""They"" refers to in this context, we need to analyze the sentence structure and logical flow of the text:

1. The first sentence introduces Pam's parents, Pam, and her boyfriend Paul.
2. The second sentence starts with ""They were furious about it.""

Given the context, it's most logical that ""They"" refers to Pam's parents for the following reasons:
- Pam's parents are the subject of the first sentence (they came home).
- It's unlikely that Pam and Paul would be furious about their own actions.
- Parents typically react with anger when finding their child in such a situation.

Therefore, ""They"" most likely refers to Pam's parents, who were furious about finding Pam and Paul having sex.",0,0
810,"Pam's parents came home and found her having sex with her boyfriend, Paul. They were embarrassed about it.",They,"0: Pam's parents, 1: Pam and Paul, 2: Neither","To determine who ""They"" refers to in this context, we need to consider the most logical interpretation based on the given information:

1. The sentence ""They were embarrassed about it"" follows immediately after mentioning that Pam's parents found Pam and Paul having sex.

2. It's more likely that Pam's parents would be embarrassed about walking in on this situation, rather than Pam and Paul being embarrassed about being caught.

3. The pronoun ""They"" is plural, which matches with ""Pam's parents"" (two people) rather than a singular entity.

4. Culturally, it's common for parents to feel embarrassed or uncomfortable when unexpectedly encountering their child in an intimate situation.

Given these points, it's most logical to conclude that ""They"" refers to Pam's parents, who were embarrassed about finding their daughter in this situation.",1,0
811,Dr. Adams informed Kate that she had retired and presented several options for future treatment.,she,"0: Dr. Adams, 1: Kate, 2: Neither","To determine who the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence mentions two people: Dr. Adams and Kate.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""she had retired.""
3. The action of retiring is more likely to be associated with Dr. Adams, who is a professional (a doctor), rather than Kate, who is presumably a patient.
4. It would make more sense for a doctor to present ""several options for future treatment"" after retiring, as they would be informing their patient about alternative care options.

Based on this analysis, it is most logical that ""she"" refers to Dr. Adams, as Dr. Adams is the one who has retired and is presenting options for future treatment to Kate.",0,0
812,Dr. Adams informed Kate that she had cancer and presented several options for future treatment.,she,"0: Dr. Adams, 1: Kate, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Kate for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure suggests that Dr. Adams is informing Kate about someone's cancer diagnosis.
2. It would be unusual for a doctor to inform a patient about the doctor's own cancer diagnosis in this context.
3. The phrase ""presented several options for future treatment"" implies that the person with cancer is the one being informed, which in this case is Kate.
4. Grammatically, ""Kate"" is the closest preceding noun that matches the gender of the pronoun ""she"".

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" in this sentence is most likely referring to Kate.",1,1
813,Dan had to stop Bill from toying with the injured bird. He is very compassionate.,He,"0: Dan, 1: Bill, 2: Neither","To determine who ""He"" refers to in this context, we need to analyze the given information and the characteristics described.

1. The first sentence tells us that Dan stopped Bill from toying with an injured bird.
2. The second sentence states that ""He is very compassionate.""

The act of stopping someone from toying with an injured bird is a compassionate action. This suggests that the person who performed this action (Dan) is the one being described as compassionate.

Dan is the one who took action to protect the injured bird, which aligns with being compassionate. Bill, on the other hand, was the one toying with the injured bird, which does not demonstrate compassion.

Therefore, it is most likely that ""He"" refers to Dan, as he demonstrated compassionate behavior by stopping Bill from potentially harming the injured bird.",0,0
814,Dan had to stop Bill from toying with the injured bird. He is very cruel.,He,"0: Dan, 1: Bill, 2: Neither","To determine who ""He"" refers to in this context, we need to analyze the sentence and the given information.

1. The first sentence states that ""Dan had to stop Bill from toying with the injured bird.""
2. The second sentence says ""He is very cruel.""

Given this information, we can deduce that the person being referred to as cruel is more likely to be Bill, not Dan. This is because:

1. Dan is described as stopping Bill from toying with the injured bird, which suggests that Dan was trying to prevent harm or cruelty to the bird.
2. Bill was the one toying with the injured bird, which can be seen as a cruel action.
3. The pronoun ""He"" in the second sentence is more likely to refer to Bill, as it's describing the person who was being cruel to the bird.

Therefore, the pronoun ""He"" most likely refers to Bill.",1,1
815,"George got free tickets to the play, but he gave them to Eric, even though he was particularly eager to see it.",he,"0: George, 1: Eric, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and logic of the sentence:

1. George got free tickets to the play.
2. George gave the tickets to Eric.
3. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the phrase ""even though he was particularly eager to see it.""

The use of ""even though"" suggests a contrast or unexpected action. It would be more unexpected for George to give away the tickets if he was particularly eager to see the play. This implies that ""he"" most likely refers to George.

If ""he"" referred to Eric, it wouldn't make sense to use ""even though"" because Eric receiving the tickets aligns with his eagerness to see the play.

Therefore, based on the logical flow and the use of ""even though,"" it is most probable that ""he"" refers to George.",0,0
816,"George got free tickets to the play, but he gave them to Eric, because he was particularly eager to see it.",he,"0: George, 1: Eric, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. George got free tickets to the play.
2. George gave the tickets to Eric.
3. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""because he was particularly eager to see it.""

The key point here is that the person who was ""particularly eager to see it"" is more likely to be the one who received the tickets, not the one who gave them away. If George was eager to see the play, he would have kept the tickets for himself. Instead, he gave them to Eric, which suggests that Eric was the one who was eager to see the play.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" in this context most likely refers to Eric.",1,1
817,"George got free tickets to the play, but he gave them to Eric, because he was not particularly eager to see it.",he,"0: George, 1: Eric, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. George got free tickets to the play.
2. George gave the tickets to Eric.
3. ""He"" was not particularly eager to see the play.

The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""because he was not particularly eager to see it."" This clause explains the reason for giving away the tickets. Since George is the one who gave away the tickets, it logically follows that George is the one who was not eager to see the play. If Eric was not eager to see it, there would be no reason for George to give him the tickets.

Therefore, ""he"" most likely refers to George in this context.",0,0
818,Jane gave Joan candy because she wasn't hungry.,she,"0: Jane, 1: Joan, 2: Neither","To determine who ""she"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context:

1. Jane gave Joan candy
2. The reason for giving candy is that ""she wasn't hungry""

Logically, the person who is not hungry would be more likely to give away candy. In this case, Jane is the one giving the candy to Joan. Therefore, it makes more sense that ""she"" refers to Jane, as Jane is the one who wasn't hungry and thus gave the candy to Joan.

The pronoun ""she"" is used to explain the motivation behind Jane's action of giving candy to Joan. It's unlikely that Joan's hunger status would be the reason for Jane giving her candy.

Based on this reasoning, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Jane.",0,0
819,Jane gave Joan candy because she was hungry.,she,"0: Jane, 1: Joan, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""because she was hungry."" Let's analyze the context:

1. Jane gave Joan candy
2. The reason for giving candy is that ""she"" was hungry

Logically, it makes more sense that Jane gave Joan candy because Joan was hungry, not because Jane herself was hungry. If Jane was hungry, she would likely eat the candy herself rather than give it to Joan.

Therefore, ""she"" in this context most likely refers to Joan, who received the candy because she was hungry.",1,1
820,"I tried to paint a picture of an orchard, with lemons in the lemon trees, but they came out looking more like light bulbs.",they,"0: lemons, 1: lemon trees, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" refers to the lemons. The context indicates that the speaker was trying to paint lemons on lemon trees, but the result was that the lemons looked more like light bulbs. The pronoun ""they"" is used to refer back to the lemons that were painted, not the trees themselves. The sentence is describing the appearance of the painted lemons, which is why ""they"" must be referring to the lemons.",0,0
821,"I tried to paint a picture of an orchard, with lemons in the lemon trees, but they came out looking more like telephone poles.",they,"0: lemons, 1: lemon trees, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" refers to the lemons. The context suggests that the speaker was trying to paint lemons on lemon trees, but the result was unsatisfactory. The phrase ""they came out looking more like telephone poles"" indicates that the lemons, which were supposed to be painted on the trees, ended up resembling telephone poles instead. This interpretation makes the most sense in the context of painting a picture, where the individual fruits (lemons) would be the objects that could potentially be mistaken for something else (telephone poles) due to poor artistic execution.",1,0
822,James asked Robert for a favor but he was refused.,he,"0: James, 1: Robert, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" is ambiguous and could refer to either James or Robert. However, based on the context, it's more likely that ""he"" refers to James. The sentence structure suggests that James is the one who was refused, not Robert. It's more natural to interpret the sentence as ""James asked Robert for a favor, but James was refused"" rather than ""James asked Robert for a favor, but Robert was refused."" Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to James.",0,0
823,James asked Robert for a favor but he refused.,he,"0: James, 1: Robert, 2: Neither","To determine who ""he"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and the most logical interpretation:

1. James is the subject of the sentence and the one performing the action of asking.
2. Robert is the object of the sentence and the one being asked for a favor.
3. The pronoun ""he"" is used in conjunction with the verb ""refused.""

Given this information, it's more likely that ""he"" refers to Robert because:
- It's more natural for the person being asked for a favor to refuse.
- If James had refused, it would be unclear what he was refusing since he was the one asking for the favor.
- The sentence structure suggests a change in subject from James to Robert, with ""he"" continuing to refer to Robert.

Therefore, the most logical interpretation is that Robert refused the favor that James asked for.",1,1
824,Kirilov ceded the presidency to Shatov because he was less popular.,he,"0: Kirilov, 1: Shatov, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence states that ""Kirilov ceded the presidency to Shatov.""
2. The reason given for this action is ""because he was less popular.""

Logically, the person who is ""less popular"" would be the one ceding the presidency, not the one receiving it. In this case:

- Kirilov is the one ceding the presidency.
- The pronoun ""he"" is used in conjunction with ""was less popular.""

Therefore, ""he"" most likely refers to Kirilov, as Kirilov's lower popularity is the reason for ceding the presidency to Shatov.",0,0
825,Kirilov ceded the presidency to Shatov because he was more popular.,he,"0: Kirilov, 1: Shatov, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence states that ""Kirilov ceded the presidency to Shatov.""
2. The reason given for this action is ""because he was more popular.""

Logically, the person who is ""more popular"" would be the one receiving the presidency, not the one giving it up. In this case, Shatov is the one receiving the presidency, so it makes sense that Shatov is the one who is more popular.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" in ""because he was more popular"" most likely refers to Shatov.",1,1
826,Emma did not pass the ball to Janie although she saw that she was open.,she,"0: Emma, 1: Janie, 2: Neither","In this sentence, there are two instances of 'she'. Let's analyze them separately:

1. First 'she': 'although she saw'
   This 'she' likely refers to Emma because Emma is the subject of the main clause and the one who didn't pass the ball. It makes sense that Emma would be the one seeing Janie open.

2. Second 'she': 'that she was open'
   This 'she' clearly refers to Janie, as being 'open' in this context means being in a position to receive a pass.

The pronoun we're asked about is just 'she', without specifying which one. Since there are two instances referring to different people, we can't definitively say which one is meant without more context. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is 'Neither', as we can't determine a single referent for 'she' in this sentence.",0,2
827,Emma did not pass the ball to Janie although she was open.,she,"0: Emma, 1: Janie, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence states that ""Emma did not pass the ball to Janie.""
2. It then adds ""although she was open.""

The use of ""although"" suggests a contrast or unexpected situation. In the context of passing a ball, being ""open"" typically means being in a good position to receive a pass. 

Given this information, it makes more sense that ""she"" refers to Janie for the following reasons:
1. If Janie was open, it would be unexpected for Emma not to pass the ball to her, which aligns with the use of ""although.""
2. It wouldn't make sense to say Emma didn't pass the ball to Janie although Emma herself was open.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Janie.",1,1
828,I put the butterfly wing on the table and it broke.,it,"0: The butterfly wing, 1: The table, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""it"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence describes two objects: the butterfly wing and the table.
2. The action of putting the butterfly wing on the table is described first.
3. The pronoun ""it"" is used in the second part of the sentence, referring to something that broke.
4. Logically, a table is much less likely to break from having a butterfly wing placed on it.
5. A butterfly wing, being delicate, is more likely to break when handled or placed on a surface.

Given this analysis, it's most logical that ""it"" refers to the butterfly wing. The butterfly wing is the object that is more likely to break in this scenario.",0,0
829,I put the heavy book on the table and it broke.,it,"0: The heavy book, 1: The table, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. The sentence describes two objects: ""the heavy book"" and ""the table"".
2. The action described is putting the book on the table.
3. The pronoun ""it"" is used in the clause ""and it broke"".
4. We need to determine which of these objects is more likely to break in this scenario.

Given the context:
- Books, even heavy ones, are not typically described as ""breaking"" when placed on a surface.
- Tables, on the other hand, can break if they're not sturdy enough to support a heavy weight.

The most logical interpretation is that ""it"" refers to the table. The heavy book was placed on the table, and as a result, the table broke, presumably due to the weight of the book.

Therefore, the pronoun ""it"" most likely refers to ""the table"".",1,1
830,Madonna fired her trainer because she couldn't stand her boyfriend.,she,"0: Madonna, 1: The trainer, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

2. The pronoun ""she"" is in the second part of the sentence.
3. Logically, the person who ""couldn't stand her boyfriend"" is more likely to be Madonna than the trainer.
4. It's more common for someone to fire an employee due to their own feelings rather than the employee's personal relationships.
5. The sentence structure suggests that ""she"" refers to the subject of the main clause (Madonna), not the object (her trainer).

Based on these points, it's most logical that ""she"" refers to Madonna. Madonna is the one who couldn't stand her trainer's boyfriend, which led her to fire the trainer.",0,0
831,Madonna fired her trainer because she slept with her boyfriend.,she,"0: Madonna, 1: The trainer, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Madonna"" as the subject, indicating she is the main actor.
2. The pronoun ""she"" appears in the clause ""she slept with her boyfriend.""
3. Given the context, it's more likely that the trainer (who is fired) is the one who slept with Madonna's boyfriend, rather than Madonna sleeping with her own boyfriend (which wouldn't typically be a reason for firing a trainer).
4. The possessive pronoun ""her"" in ""her boyfriend"" likely refers back to Madonna, further supporting that Madonna is not the ""she"" who slept with the boyfriend.

832,Madonna fired her trainer because she slept with her boyfriend.,her,"0: Madonna, 1: The trainer, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which 'her' the pronoun refers to.

   - Carol believed
   - Rebecca regretted
   - she had stolen the watch

2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the last part of the sentence, referring to the person who stole the watch.

3. Given the structure of the sentence, it's more likely that ""she"" refers to Rebecca rather than Carol. This is because:
   - Rebecca is the subject of the clause immediately preceding the pronoun.
   - The action of regretting is more closely linked to the action of stealing the watch.
   - It would be more natural for Rebecca to regret her own action (stealing the watch) rather than Carol's action.

4. There's no indication in the sentence that ""she"" could refer to someone other than Carol or Rebecca, so we can rule out the ""Neither"" option.

Based on these observations, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Rebecca.",1,"1

2. The book is said to have introduced Shakespeare to Ovid.
3. The pronoun ""his"" is used in the phrase ""his writing.""

Given this information, it's more logical that ""his"" refers to Shakespeare for the following reasons:
- The sentence structure suggests that Shakespeare is the main subject, as he is being introduced to Ovid.
- The book's influence is mentioned in relation to ""his writing,"" which is more likely to refer to Shakespeare, the renowned writer, rather than Ovid, who is mentioned as the subject Shakespeare was introduced to.

1. The sentence mentions that ""This book introduced Shakespeare to Ovid.""
2. It then says ""it was a fine selection of his writing.""

The pronoun ""his"" is more likely to refer to Ovid for the following reasons:
- The book is introducing Shakespeare to Ovid's work, implying that Shakespeare is being exposed to Ovid's writing.
- It would be unusual for a book introducing Shakespeare to Ovid to contain Shakespeare's own writing.
- The phrase ""a fine selection of his writing"" suggests that the book contains excerpts or chosen works, which aligns with the idea of introducing one author (Shakespeare) to another author's (Ovid's) writing.

1. The pronoun ""she"" is used in reference to someone who always wears a red turban.
2. This distinctive feature (wearing a red turban) is what allows Alice to spot the person quickly.

3. The phrase ""because they were so advanced"" logically applies to the chatbots, not the judges. It wouldn't make sense to say the judges couldn't figure out which respondents were chatbots because the judges were so advanced.
4. The advancement of the chatbots is the reason for the judges' difficulty, supporting that ""they"" refers to the chatbots.

Therefore, the pronoun ""they"" most likely refers to ""the chatbots"" in this context.",1,1
846,"The user changed his password from ""GrWQWu8JyC"" toÂ ""willow-towered Canopy Huntertropic wrestles"" as it was easy to forget.",it,"0: GrWQWu8JyC, 1: willow-towered Canopy Huntertropic wrestles, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""it"" refers to the old password ""GrWQWu8JyC"". The context suggests that the user changed their password because the old one was easy to forget. The phrase ""as it was easy to forget"" directly follows the mention of the old password, indicating that ""it"" is referring to ""GrWQWu8JyC"".

The new password ""willow-towered Canopy Huntertropic wrestles"" is not described as being easy to forget. In fact, it seems to be a more complex and potentially more memorable password, which is likely why the user changed to it.

Therefore, the pronoun ""it"" refers to the first candidate, ""GrWQWu8JyC"".",0,0
847,"The user changed his password from ""GrWQWu8JyC"" toÂ ""willow-towered Canopy Huntertropic wrestles"" as it was easy to remember.",it,"0: GrWQWu8JyC, 1: willow-towered Canopy Huntertropic wrestles, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""it"" refers to the new password ""willow-towered Canopy Huntertropic wrestles"". The reasoning is as follows:

1. The sentence describes a change of password from an old one to a new one.
2. The pronoun ""it"" is used in the context of being ""easy to remember"".
3. Logically, the new password is the one that is described as easy to remember, not the old one.
4. The phrase ""willow-towered Canopy Huntertropic wrestles"" is a more complex and descriptive password, which aligns with the idea of being easier to remember compared to a random string of characters like ""GrWQWu8JyC"".

Therefore, ""it"" refers to the new password, which is candidate 1.",1,1
848,"Seymour sought Johnson's support, but he long remained silent on the presidential campaign.",he,"0: Seymour, 1: Johnson, 2: Neither","To determine who the pronoun ""he"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and grammatical structure:

1. The sentence starts with ""Seymour sought Johnson's support,"" indicating that Seymour is the active subject performing the action of seeking support.

2. The second part of the sentence, ""but he long remained silent on the presidential campaign,"" is connected to the first part with the conjunction ""but,"" suggesting a contrast or unexpected result.

3. The pronoun ""he"" is more likely to refer to the person who is not explicitly named in the second part of the sentence, as it would be redundant to repeat a name that was just mentioned.

4. Logically, it makes more sense that Johnson would be the one remaining silent on the presidential campaign, as Seymour is already described as actively seeking support.

Based on these points, it is most likely that ""he"" refers to Johnson, not Seymour.",1,1
849,"French statesman Leon Gambetta expressed a desire to meet Rodin, and the sculptor impressed him when they met at a salon.",him,"0: Rodin, 1: French statesman Leon Gambetta, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""him"" refers to Leon Gambetta. The sentence structure indicates that Gambetta expressed a desire to meet Rodin, and then ""the sculptor impressed him."" The sculptor in this context is Rodin, and the person being impressed is Gambetta. Therefore, ""him"" refers to Gambetta, who is the one being impressed by Rodin when they met at the salon.",0,1
850,"The leader of the Alaska Federation of Natives protested against Hickel's nomination, but he was eventually confirmed.",he,"0: The leader of the Alaska Federation of Natives, 1: Hickel, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and grammatical structure of the sentence:

1. The sentence mentions two entities: ""The leader of the Alaska Federation of Natives"" and ""Hickel.""
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the second part of the sentence, after the comma.
3. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" refers to the person who ""was eventually confirmed.""
4. Given the context, it's more likely that the confirmation process is related to Hickel's nomination, not the leader of the Alaska Federation of Natives.
5. The leader of the Alaska Federation of Natives is mentioned as protesting against Hickel's nomination, which implies they are not the subject of the confirmation.

Based on these points, it's most logical to conclude that ""he"" refers to Hickel, who was the subject of the nomination and confirmation process.",1,1
851,"Fernando identifies Antonio Gramsci as an influential early theorist of advanced capitalism, even if he did not use the term himself.",he,"0: Antonio Gramsci, 1: Fernando, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence is about Fernando identifying Antonio Gramsci as an influential theorist.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""even if he did not use the term himself.""
3. This clause is providing additional information about the person who is being described as an influential theorist.
4. It's more likely that this additional information is about Antonio Gramsci, not Fernando.
5. The sentence is structured in a way that suggests Fernando is making an observation about Gramsci, including the fact that Gramsci didn't use a particular term.

Based on this analysis, it's most logical that ""he"" refers to Antonio Gramsci, as the sentence is primarily about Gramsci's role as a theorist, with Fernando being the one making the identification.",0,0
852,"Anne trusts Kirsty, but she eventually discovers her affair with Fiz.",her,"0: Anne, 1: Kirsty, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. The pronoun ""her"" is used in the phrase ""her affair with Fiz.""
2. The sentence structure suggests that ""she"" (referring to Anne) discovers something about someone else.
3. The affair is described as being ""with Fiz,"" which implies that Fiz is not the person having the affair, but rather the person Kirsty is having an affair with.
4. Given this context, ""her"" must refer to Kirsty, as she is the one having the affair that Anne discovers.

Therefore, the pronoun ""her"" in this sentence refers to Kirsty.",0,1
853,David Platt has kicked Andre out after he learned that he had taken his son's medication.,he,"0: Andre, 1: David Platt, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""he"" the pronoun refers to. Let's break it down:

1. The first ""he"" in the sentence: ""...after he learned...""
   This ""he"" likely refers to David Platt, as he is the one who kicked Andre out after learning something.

2. The second ""he"" in the sentence: ""...that he had taken...""
   This ""he"" likely refers to Andre, as it describes the action that led to him being kicked out.

The pronoun we're asked about is not specified as the first or second ""he"" in the sentence. However, given the context, it's more likely that the pronoun refers to David Platt. The sentence is primarily about David Platt's action (kicking Andre out) and his reason for doing so (learning about the medication). David Platt is the main subject of the sentence, making him the more probable referent for an unspecified ""he"".",1,1
854,"Dolly was named after performer Dolly Parton because the cells cloned to make her were from a mammary gland cell, and Parton is known for her ample cleavage.",her,"0: Dolly, 1: performer Dolly Parton, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""her"" the pronoun refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. The first ""her"" in the sentence clearly refers to Dolly the sheep, as it's talking about why she was named.
2. The second ""her"" is part of the phrase ""her ample cleavage,"" which is describing Dolly Parton.

The pronoun ""her"" in question is the second occurrence in the sentence. It is directly associated with ""ample cleavage,"" which is a characteristic attributed to Dolly Parton, not the cloned sheep. Therefore, this ""her"" refers to performer Dolly Parton.",0,1
855,De Vries kills Yueh but he also dies with Leto in the assassination attempt; however Harkonnen survives.,he,"0: Yueh, 1: De Vries, 2: Neither","Let's analyze the sentence:
""De Vries kills Yueh but he also dies with Leto in the assassination attempt; however Harkonnen survives.""

The pronoun ""he"" in this sentence refers to De Vries for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure indicates that the subject of the first clause (De Vries) is also the subject of the second clause (containing ""he"").
2. The use of ""but"" and ""also"" suggests that the same person who kills Yueh (De Vries) is the one who dies.
3. It wouldn't make sense for ""he"" to refer to Yueh, as Yueh is already killed by De Vries in the first part of the sentence.
4. The pronoun cannot refer to Leto or Harkonnen, as they are introduced later in the sentence and are not part of the given candidates.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to De Vries (candidate 1).",1,1
856,"Daisy usually shows a strong affinity towards Laura, although she is often characterised as being more sophisticated than her.",she,"0: Daisy, 1: Laura, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" is most likely referring to Daisy. The reasoning behind this is:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""she"" is being compared to Laura, which implies that ""she"" is not Laura.
2. The phrase ""although she is often characterised as being more sophisticated than her"" is providing additional information about one of the two people mentioned, and it's more likely to be about the subject of the sentence (Daisy) rather than the object (Laura).
3. The use of ""her"" at the end of the sentence further supports that ""she"" refers to Daisy, as it's creating a comparison between the two individuals.

Therefore, based on the context and sentence structure, ""she"" most likely refers to Daisy.",0,0
857,"Enki does not tell Atrahasis directly, but he speaks to him in secret via a reed wall.",him,"0: Enki, 1: Atrahasis, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""him"" refers to Atrahasis. The context indicates that Enki is speaking to someone, and that someone is Atrahasis. The sentence structure suggests that Enki (the subject) is performing an action (speaking) directed towards Atrahasis (the object). The pronoun ""him"" is used to refer back to Atrahasis, who is the recipient of Enki's secret communication.",1,1
858,"Joey develops romantic feelings for Ross, but he does not reciprocate them.",he,"0: Joey, 1: Ross, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""he"" refers to. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" is referring to Ross, not Joey. This is because:

1. Joey is the subject of the first clause, developing romantic feelings.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the second clause, indicating a shift in subject.
3. The verb ""reciprocate"" implies that the person referred to by ""he"" is the object of Joey's feelings, which would be Ross.

Therefore, ""he"" in this context refers to Ross, who does not reciprocate Joey's romantic feelings.",1,1
859,"Gnumeric was created and developed by Miguel de Icaza, but he has since moved on to other projects.",he,"0: Gnumeric, 1: Miguel de Icaza, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" clearly refers to Miguel de Icaza. The sentence structure indicates that Miguel de Icaza created and developed Gnumeric, and then the pronoun ""he"" is used to refer back to Miguel de Icaza when stating that he has moved on to other projects. Gnumeric is a software application and cannot ""move on to other projects,"" so it cannot be the referent of ""he."" Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Miguel de Icaza, which is candidate 1.",0,1
860,Warner Bros. Chairman took considerable notice of Nolan's desires and thoughts when drafting his contract.,his,"0: Nolan, 1: Warner Bros. Chairman, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""his"" most likely refers to Nolan for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure suggests that Nolan's desires and thoughts are the focus of the Warner Bros. Chairman's attention.
2. It's more logical for a studio chairman to consider the desires and thoughts of a director (Nolan) when drafting a contract, rather than their own.
3. The possessive pronoun ""his"" is used in conjunction with ""desires and thoughts,"" which are more likely to belong to the person whose contract is being drafted (Nolan) rather than the person drafting it (Warner Bros. Chairman).

Therefore, the pronoun ""his"" most likely refers to Nolan.",1,0
861,Trotsky refused to support Lenin since he was waiting to see whether German workers would rebel and whether German soldiers would refuse to follow orders.,he,"0: Trotsky, 1: Lenin, 2: Neither","To determine who the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence starts with ""Trotsky refused to support Lenin.""
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""since he was waiting to see...""
3. The action of ""waiting to see"" is more likely to be associated with Trotsky's decision not to support Lenin, rather than Lenin himself.
4. It would make more sense for Trotsky to be the one waiting to see the reactions of German workers and soldiers before making a decision to support Lenin or not.
5. If ""he"" referred to Lenin, the sentence would imply that Lenin was waiting to see these reactions, which doesn't align with the context of Trotsky refusing to support him.

Based on this analysis, it is most logical that the pronoun ""he"" refers to Trotsky.",1,0
862,"Giovanni went to stay with Lucrezia in Ferrara after Alexander's death, where he was accepted as her half-brother.",he,"0: Giovanni, 1: Alexander, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, let's analyze the sentence:

1. The sentence starts with ""Giovanni went to stay with Lucrezia in Ferrara.""
2. This action occurred ""after Alexander's death.""
3. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""he was accepted as her half-brother.""

Given this information:
- ""He"" is most likely referring to Giovanni because:
  a) Giovanni is the subject of the main action (going to stay with Lucrezia).
  b) The pronoun ""he"" is used in relation to being accepted as Lucrezia's half-brother.
  c) Alexander is mentioned as deceased, so ""he"" cannot refer to Alexander in this context.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Giovanni.",0,0
863,"Henry appears to have been uncertain what to do with Rhys, but after a few weeks he decided to free him and allow him to rule Cantref Mawr.",him,"0: Henry, 1: Rhys, 2: Neither","In this sentence, there are two instances of the pronoun ""him"". Let's analyze each:

1. ""...he decided to free him...""
2. ""...and allow him to rule Cantref Mawr.""

Both instances of ""him"" refer to the same person, and this person is not Henry (who is the subject doing the freeing and allowing). The pronoun ""him"" is referring to Rhys, as he is the one being freed and allowed to rule Cantref Mawr.

The sentence structure indicates that Henry is the one making decisions about Rhys, which further supports that ""him"" refers to Rhys and not Henry.",0,1
864,"Sennacherib was probably not the first-born son of Sargon II, but he was groomed for royal succession and entrusted with administrative duties from an early age.",he,"0: Sennacherib, 1: Sargon II, 2: Neither","The pronoun ""he"" in this context clearly refers to Sennacherib. The sentence is primarily about Sennacherib and his relationship to Sargon II. The pronoun is used in the clause ""he was groomed for royal succession,"" which logically applies to Sennacherib as the subject of the sentence. Sargon II is mentioned only as Sennacherib's father, not as the main subject of the sentence or the one being groomed for succession.",0,0
865,"Antietam was primarily a defensive battle against superior odds, although McClellan failed to exploit his advantage.",his,"0: Antietam, 1: McClellan, 2: Neither","The pronoun ""his"" in this sentence refers to McClellan. The context of the sentence indicates that McClellan had an advantage that he failed to exploit. Antietam is mentioned as the location of the battle, not as a person who could possess an advantage. Therefore, ""his"" must be referring to McClellan, who is the only person mentioned in the sentence.",0,1
866,"The Maker's madness takes control of several inmates, but is finally subdued by Thanos and several of his allies among the prisoners.",his,"0: The Maker, 1: Thanos, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""his"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence mentions two main characters: The Maker and Thanos.
2. The pronoun ""his"" is used in the phrase ""his allies among the prisoners.""
3. The sentence structure indicates that Thanos is the one who subdues the Maker's madness, along with allies.
4. It's more logical that Thanos would have allies among the prisoners, rather than the Maker, who is causing the madness.

Based on this analysis, it's most likely that ""his"" refers to Thanos, as he is the one working with allies to subdue the Maker's madness.",0,1
867,"If Keen touches an enemy, he immediately loses a life.",he,"0: an enemy, 1: Keen, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" clearly refers to Keen. The sentence is describing what happens to Keen when he touches an enemy. It wouldn't make sense for ""he"" to refer to ""an enemy"" in this context, as the enemy is not the subject of the action. The sentence is about Keen losing a life, not about what happens to the enemy.",0,1
868,"The Catholic bishop had supported the Danish King Christian II, but he was overthrown by Gustavus Vasa, and Sweden was now independent again.",he,"0: The Catholic bishop, 1: the Danish King Christian II, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and grammatical structure of the sentence. 

1. The sentence mentions two male individuals: the Catholic bishop and King Christian II.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""but he was overthrown by Gustavus Vasa.""
3. The use of ""but"" indicates a contrast or change in the situation.
4. It's more logical that a king would be overthrown rather than a bishop in this historical context.
5. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" refers to the subject of the previous clause, which is King Christian II.

Based on these observations, it's most likely that ""he"" refers to King Christian II, not the Catholic bishop.",1,1
869,"Previous to that Lucy was in service with Mrs. Vincent, but very little is known about her past before this.",her,"0: Lucy, 1: Mrs. Vincent, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""her"" is most likely referring to Lucy. The sentence is primarily about Lucy's past, mentioning her previous employment with Mrs. Vincent. The phrase ""her past"" at the end of the sentence is discussing Lucy's history before her time in service with Mrs. Vincent. It would not make sense for ""her past"" to refer to Mrs. Vincent in this context, as Mrs. Vincent is only mentioned as Lucy's previous employer.",0,0
870,"An infuriated McCauley tries to kill Waingro afterwards, but he escapes.",he,"0: Waingro, 1: McCauley, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. McCauley is described as ""infuriated"" and trying to kill Waingro.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""but he escapes.""

Given this information, it's more logical that ""he"" refers to Waingro for the following reasons:
- The action of escaping makes more sense for the person being attacked (Waingro) rather than the attacker (McCauley).
- The sentence structure suggests a contrast between McCauley's attempt to kill and someone escaping, which implies two different subjects.
- It would be redundant and less coherent to say that McCauley is trying to kill Waingro but then McCauley escapes.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Waingro.",0,0
871,Amartya Sen was critical of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi when he was announced as the prime ministerial candidate by the BJP.,he,"0: Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, 1: Amartya Sen, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Narendra Modi. The context indicates that Amartya Sen was critical of Narendra Modi when Modi was announced as the prime ministerial candidate. The pronoun ""he"" is used to refer to the person being announced as the candidate, which is clearly Narendra Modi in this case. Amartya Sen is the subject of the sentence and is doing the criticizing, so the pronoun cannot refer to him.",1,0
872,"Paul tries to comfort Heathcliff, but he vows revenge on Hindley.",he,"0: Paul, 1: Heathcliff, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""he"" refers to: Paul or Heathcliff. Let's analyze the context:

1. Paul is trying to comfort Heathcliff.
2. ""He"" vows revenge on Hindley.

Given this information, it's more logical that Heathcliff is the one vowing revenge, not Paul. Paul is described as trying to comfort Heathcliff, which suggests he's not the one seeking revenge. Additionally, in the context of the story ""Wuthering Heights,"" Heathcliff is known for his desire for revenge against Hindley.

Therefore, ""he"" in this sentence most likely refers to Heathcliff.",1,1
873,"Hareton tries to be kind to Cathy, but she withdraws from the world.",she,"0: Hareton, 1: Cathy, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence mentions two characters: Hareton and Cathy.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the second part of the sentence.
3. The action associated with ""she"" is ""withdraws from the world.""

Given this information, we can deduce that ""she"" refers to Cathy for the following reasons:
1. ""She"" is a feminine pronoun, which matches Cathy (typically a female name) rather than Hareton (typically a male name).
2. The sentence structure suggests a contrast between Hareton's actions and the subject of ""she."" Hareton tries to be kind, but ""she"" (the other person) withdraws.
3. It would be illogical for Hareton to both try to be kind and withdraw from the world in the same sentence.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Cathy.",1,1
874,"Obi-Wan visits Yoda to learn of Anakin's whereabouts, but he refuses to give him the location as he knows that he will kill him.",he,"0: Yoda, 1: Obi-Wan, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. The first ""he"" in the sentence refers to Yoda. This is clear because it's Yoda who is refusing to give the location.

2. The second ""he"" also refers to Yoda. This is because Yoda knows something about the consequences of giving the location.

3. The third ""he"" refers to Obi-Wan. This is because Obi-Wan is the one who would potentially kill Anakin if given the location.

4. The final ""him"" refers to Anakin, who is not one of the given candidates.

The question asks specifically about the pronoun ""he"". In this sentence, ""he"" is used multiple times, but it most prominently refers to Yoda (twice) and then to Obi-Wan (once). Since Yoda is mentioned first in the candidate list and is also the subject of the main clause (refusing to give the location), it's most likely that the ""he"" in question refers to Yoda.",0,0
875,"Six weeks before the Championships, Blankers-Koen gave birth to Fanny Junior, but this had not stopped her from resuming training shortly afterwards.",her,"0: Blankers-Koen, 1: Fanny Junior, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""her"" clearly refers to Blankers-Koen for several reasons:

1. Blankers-Koen is the main subject of the sentence and the person performing the actions (giving birth and resuming training).

2. The context indicates that ""her"" is referring to the person who resumed training after giving birth. Logically, this would be the mother (Blankers-Koen) and not the newborn child (Fanny Junior).

3. The sentence structure suggests that ""her"" is referring back to the subject of the first clause (Blankers-Koen), maintaining continuity in the narrative.

4. It wouldn't make sense for ""her"" to refer to Fanny Junior, as a newborn infant would not be resuming training.

Therefore, the pronoun ""her"" in this context clearly refers to Blankers-Koen.",1,0
876,Bill finally is sent overseas and Jack tearfully runs after his departing train to tell him goodbye.,his,"0: Bill, 1: Jack, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""his"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence describes two people: Bill and Jack.
2. Bill is being sent overseas, which implies he's leaving.
3. Jack is running after a departing train.
4. The pronoun ""his"" is used in the phrase ""his departing train"".

Given this information, we can deduce that ""his departing train"" refers to Bill's train. Jack is the one running after the train, so it can't be Jack's train. The train is departing with Bill on it, so it makes sense to refer to it as Bill's train.

Therefore, the pronoun ""his"" most likely refers to Bill.",0,0
877,"Horus fought battles against Set, until he finally achieved victory and became the ruler of Egypt.",he,"0: Horus, 1: Set, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Horus for the following reasons:

1. Horus is the subject of the sentence and the main focus of the action.
2. The sentence describes Horus fighting battles against Set.
3. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the context of achieving victory and becoming the ruler of Egypt, which logically follows from Horus winning the battles against Set.
4. There is no indication in the sentence that the subject changes from Horus to Set.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Horus in this context.",0,0
878,"Heracles freed Theseus from the stone, but the earth shook when he attempted to liberate Pirithous.",he,"0: Heracles, 1: Theseus, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Heracles. The reasoning is as follows:

1. The sentence describes two actions: freeing Theseus and attempting to liberate Pirithous.
2. Both actions are performed by the same subject, as indicated by the use of ""but"" to connect the two clauses.
3. The first action, ""Heracles freed Theseus,"" clearly establishes Heracles as the subject.
4. Therefore, when the pronoun ""he"" is used in the second part of the sentence, it logically refers back to Heracles, who is continuing to perform actions.

The pronoun ""he"" cannot refer to Theseus because Theseus is the object of the first action (being freed) and is not described as performing any actions himself.",1,0
879,"George III initially humoured Gordon, but he grew increasingly irritated with him and eventually refused any future audiences.",him,"0: Gordon, 1: George III, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""him"" refers to Gordon, not George III. The context suggests that George III is the subject who is performing the actions: he initially humoured Gordon, grew irritated, and refused future audiences. The pronoun ""him"" is used as the object of these actions, referring to the person being humoured and then refused audiences, which is Gordon.",0,0
880,"Alice has no definite information about the weather where Rachel lives, but she knows general trends.",she,"0: Alice, 1: Rachel, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" refers to Alice. The sentence is describing Alice's knowledge about the weather where Rachel lives. The subject of the sentence is Alice, and the pronoun ""she"" is used to continue referring to Alice as the subject who ""knows general trends"" about the weather. There's no indication that the pronoun switches to refer to Rachel.",0,0
881,"Although Dorothy loves Jane, she breaks up with her because she believes that she does not love her.",she,"0: Dorothy, 1: Jane, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""she"" refers to Dorothy or Jane. Let's break it down:

1. ""Although Dorothy loves Jane, she breaks up with her...""
   - This ""she"" is likely referring to Dorothy, as she is the subject of the sentence and the one taking action (breaking up).

2. ""...because she believes that...""
   - This ""she"" is also likely referring to Dorothy, as it's continuing the thought from the previous clause.

3. ""...she does not love her.""
   - This final ""she"" is more ambiguous, but in the context of the entire sentence, it makes more sense if it refers to Jane. Dorothy is breaking up with Jane because Dorothy believes that Jane doesn't love her (Dorothy).

Given this analysis, the pronoun ""she"" in this sentence most often refers to Dorothy. While there is one instance where it might refer to Jane, the overall subject of the sentence is Dorothy, and she is the one performing the main actions (breaking up and believing).",0,0
882,"Barbara disapproves, and plans to marry Emma, but Pierre whisks her away in a speedboat.",her,"0: Barbara, 1: Emma, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""her"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions three people: Barbara, Emma, and Pierre.
2. The pronoun ""her"" is used in the phrase ""whisks her away.""
3. The action of whisking someone away is more likely to be done to the person being married (Emma) rather than the person disapproving (Barbara).
4. The sentence structure suggests that Pierre is taking action against Barbara's plans by whisking Emma away.

Based on this analysis, it is most logical that ""her"" refers to Emma, as she is the one likely being whisked away by Pierre, contrary to Barbara's plans to marry her.",0,1
883,Emma promises to teach Sophie magic if she agrees to have sex with her.,she,"0: Emma, 1: Sophie, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Emma is making a promise to Sophie.
2. The condition for teaching magic is that ""she agrees to have sex with her.""

Given the structure of the sentence, ""she"" is more likely to refer to Sophie for the following reasons:
- Emma is the one making the offer, so she would be the one setting the conditions.
- The pronoun ""she"" is used in the context of agreeing to the condition, which logically would be Sophie's action.
- The phrase ""have sex with her"" implies that ""she"" (the subject) would be having sex with ""her"" (Emma, the person making the offer).

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Sophie in this context.",1,1
884,Archer would occasionally leave Porthos in the care of Dr. Phlox when he was away or otherwise unavailable.,he,"0: Archer, 1: Porthos, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Archer for the following reasons:

1. Archer is mentioned first in the sentence, making him the primary subject.
2. The sentence structure suggests that Archer is the one taking the action of leaving Porthos in someone else's care.
3. The phrase ""when he was away or otherwise unavailable"" logically applies to Archer, as he would be the one needing to arrange care for Porthos.
4. It wouldn't make sense for ""he"" to refer to Porthos, as dogs typically don't arrange their own care.
5. Dr. Phlox is not one of the candidates, so ""he"" cannot refer to him.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Archer.",0,0
885,Peck agreed to portray Mengele only because he had wanted to work with Olivier.,he,"0: Peck, 1: Mengele, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Peck. The sentence structure indicates that Peck is the subject who agreed to portray Mengele, and the reason for this agreement is that Peck (not Mengele) wanted to work with Olivier. The pronoun ""he"" is used to refer back to Peck, who is the main subject of the sentence and the one making the decision to portray Mengele.",0,0
886,"The musician is too badly shaken up to answer Nick's questions, though Nora's presence seems to calm him down.",him,"0: The musician, 1: Nick, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. The pronoun ""him"" is masculine and singular, so it must refer to a male individual.
2. We have three potential referents: the musician, Nick, and Nora.
3. Nora is female, so we can eliminate her.
4. The sentence structure suggests that ""him"" refers to the musician:
   - The musician is described as being ""too badly shaken up""
   - Nora's presence is said to calm ""him"" down
   - This implies that ""him"" is the same person who is shaken up, which is the musician
5. Nick is mentioned, but only in the context of asking questions. The pronoun doesn't seem to refer to Nick in this context.

Therefore, the most logical conclusion is that ""him"" refers to the musician.",0,0
887,"Mr. Bagby fires Hector, but he reinstates him when he discovers that Mr. Sykes has been arrested for gambling with company money.",him,"0: Hector, 1: Mr. Bagby, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. ""Mr. Bagby fires Hector"" - This establishes the initial action.
2. ""but he reinstates him"" - Here, ""he"" refers to Mr. Bagby (the subject of the first clause), and ""him"" refers to Hector (the object of the first clause).
3. ""when he discovers that Mr. Sykes has been arrested"" - This ""he"" also refers to Mr. Bagby, as he's the one doing the reinstating and discovering.

The pronoun ""him"" in this sentence is clearly referring to Hector. Mr. Bagby is the one doing the action (reinstating), and Hector is the one being reinstated. It wouldn't make sense for Mr. Bagby to reinstate himself.

Therefore, the pronoun ""him"" refers to Hector, which is candidate 0.",0,0
888,David Cameron later accused Gaitskell of betrayal when he publicly condemned the military operation in November.,he,"0: Gaitskell, 1: David Cameron, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Gaitskell, not David Cameron. The sentence structure indicates that David Cameron is the subject who accused Gaitskell of betrayal. The pronoun ""he"" is used to describe the action of publicly condemning the military operation, which is attributed to Gaitskell. This makes sense in the context of Cameron accusing Gaitskell of betrayal, as Gaitskell's public condemnation of the operation would be seen as the act of betrayal from Cameron's perspective.",0,0
889,"Pierre attempts to put Aguirre in chains, but he and a soldier loyal to him are shot.",he,"0: Aguirre, 1: Pierre, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Pierre is the subject of the first clause, attempting to put Aguirre in chains.
2. The second clause mentions ""he and a soldier loyal to him are shot.""

Given this information, it's more likely that ""he"" refers to Pierre for the following reasons:
- The sentence starts with Pierre as the active subject.
- It would be unusual for Aguirre to be shot along with a soldier loyal to him while Pierre is trying to chain him.
- The structure of the sentence suggests a continuation of events happening to Pierre: he tries to chain Aguirre, but then he (Pierre) is shot.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Pierre.",0,1
890,Elizabeth later breaks up with Erica when she finds out she is cheating on her.,she,"0: Elizabeth, 1: Erica, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""she"" the pronoun refers to. Let's break it down:

1. ""Elizabeth later breaks up with Erica"" - This establishes Elizabeth as the subject and Erica as the object of the first part of the sentence.

2. ""when she finds out"" - This ""she"" likely refers to Elizabeth, as she is the one taking action (breaking up) based on new information.

3. ""she is cheating on her"" - This part contains two pronouns:
   - The first ""she"" refers to Erica, as she is the one who is cheating.
   - The ""her"" at the end refers to Elizabeth, as she is the one being cheated on.

Given this analysis, the pronoun ""she"" in question most likely refers to Elizabeth, as she is the one finding out about the cheating and subsequently breaking up with Erica.",0,0
891,"Trin later caused the death of the Nandorin elf Saeros, after the latter gave him a mortal insult.",him,"0: Trin, 1: the Nandorin elf Saeros, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""him"" refers to Trin. The sentence structure indicates that Saeros gave an insult to someone, and that someone is logically Trin. The pronoun ""him"" is used as the object of the verb ""gave,"" and Trin is the only other person mentioned in the sentence who could be the recipient of the insult. Additionally, the sentence begins by mentioning Trin as the subject, making him the primary focus of the statement.",0,0
892,"Though Morgoth feared Fingolfin, he had to accept the challenge or face shame in the eyes of his servants.",he,"0: Morgoth, 1: Fingolfin, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Morgoth. The context indicates that Morgoth is the subject who ""had to accept the challenge"" despite fearing Fingolfin. The sentence structure suggests that Morgoth is the one facing the decision to either accept the challenge or face shame. Therefore, ""he"" in this case is referring to Morgoth.",1,0
893,Montoya still had a contractual relationship with Williams and after his impressive rookie season the Grove-based team were keen for him to drive for them in Formula One.,his,"0: Montoya, 1: Williams, 2: Neither","The pronoun ""his"" in this context clearly refers to Montoya for several reasons:

1. Montoya is the main subject of the sentence and the first person mentioned.
2. The phrase ""his impressive rookie season"" is describing Montoya's performance, not Williams (which is a team, not an individual).
3. The sentence structure indicates that Williams (the team) was keen for Montoya to drive for them, based on his performance.

Therefore, ""his"" is referring to Montoya's rookie season, not to Williams or any other entity.",1,0
894,Alice heads out looking for Jessica when she does not return.,she,"0: Alice, 1: Jessica, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Alice is the subject of the sentence and is performing the action of ""heading out"".
2. Jessica is mentioned as the person Alice is looking for.
3. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""when she does not return"".

Given this information, it's more logical that ""she"" refers to Jessica rather than Alice. The sentence implies that Alice is going to look for Jessica because Jessica has not returned. It wouldn't make sense for Alice to be looking for Jessica if Alice herself had not returned.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Jessica.",1,1
895,"Rod Steiger wanted to play Max Cady, but he backed off when he heard Mitchum was considering the role.",he,"0: Max Cady, 1: Rod Steiger, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""he"" refers to. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" refers to Rod Steiger, not Max Cady. The sentence begins by mentioning Rod Steiger's desire to play Max Cady, and then uses ""he"" to describe an action (backing off) that logically follows from the initial desire. It wouldn't make sense for Max Cady, a character role, to back off from considering himself. Therefore, ""he"" most likely refers to Rod Steiger.",1,1
896,"Lionel Barrymore had been first picked to play Davidson, but was thought to be too ill at the time, though he did eventually win the role.",he,"0: Davidson, 1: Lionel Barrymore, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. The sentence mentions two people: Lionel Barrymore and Davidson.
2. The pronoun ""he"" appears in the phrase ""he did eventually win the role.""
3. The sentence structure suggests that Lionel Barrymore was initially considered for the role of Davidson but was thought to be too ill.
4. However, the last part of the sentence indicates that despite initial doubts, someone did eventually win the role.
5. Given the context, it's most logical that ""he"" refers to Lionel Barrymore, as the sentence is describing his journey from being initially passed over for the role to eventually securing it.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Lionel Barrymore.",0,1
897,Malebranche was strongly influenced by Descartes but he did not accept his philosophy uncritically.,his,"0: Malebranche, 1: Descartes, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""his"" refers to Descartes, not Malebranche. The context suggests that Malebranche was influenced by Descartes' philosophy, but did not accept it uncritically. The phrase ""his philosophy"" is referring to the philosophy of Descartes, which Malebranche was evaluating. It wouldn't make sense for Malebranche to not accept his own philosophy uncritically.",1,1
898,Neda falls in love with Rita even though there are rumors that she is Van Tuyl's mistress.,she,"0: Neda, 1: Rita, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence is about Neda falling in love with Rita.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""there are rumors that she is Van Tuyl's mistress.""
3. Logically, it makes more sense for the rumors to be about Rita being Van Tuyl's mistress rather than Neda.
4. The sentence structure suggests that ""she"" refers to Rita, as it's more natural to provide additional information about the object of the sentence (Rita) rather than the subject (Neda).

Based on these points, it's most likely that ""she"" refers to Rita.",1,1
899,"Doctor initially told Kennedy the tumor was inoperable, but he looked around for other opinions and decided on the most aggressive and exhausting course of treatment possible.",he,"0: Doctor, 1: Kennedy, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Kennedy, not the Doctor. This can be determined from the context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Doctor initially told Kennedy"" about the tumor.
2. Then, it says ""but he looked around for other opinions,"" which implies that the person seeking other opinions is the patient (Kennedy) rather than the doctor.
3. The phrase ""decided on the most aggressive and exhausting course of treatment possible"" further supports that it's Kennedy making this decision for his own treatment.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" in this context refers to Kennedy (candidate 1).",1,1
900,"Jessica tries to restore Razel, but she turns her into a rook instead.",her,"0: Jessica, 1: Razel, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""her"" refers to Razel for the following reasons:

1. The context suggests that Jessica is performing an action (trying to restore) on Razel.
2. The pronoun ""her"" is used in the phrase ""turns her into a rook,"" which implies that someone is being transformed.
3. It wouldn't make sense for Jessica to turn herself into a rook, as she is the one performing the action.
4. Razel is the logical recipient of the action, as she is the one being restored and subsequently transformed.

Therefore, the pronoun ""her"" refers to Razel (candidate 1).",0,1
901,"Giuseppe Zangara was the assassin of Chicago mayor Anton Cermak, though United States Presidentelect Franklin D. Roosevelt may have been his intended target.",his,"0: Chicago mayor Anton Cermak, 1: Giuseppe Zangara, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""his"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence. The pronoun ""his"" is used in the phrase ""his intended target,"" which is discussing the potential target of an assassination attempt.

Given the information provided:
1. Giuseppe Zangara is identified as the assassin.
2. Anton Cermak is mentioned as the victim of the assassination.
3. Franklin D. Roosevelt is mentioned as a possible intended target.

The pronoun ""his"" is most likely referring to Giuseppe Zangara, as he is the assassin and the sentence is discussing his potential intended target. It wouldn't make sense for ""his"" to refer to Anton Cermak or for it to be unrelated to either of the given candidates.

Therefore, the pronoun ""his"" refers to Giuseppe Zangara (candidate 1).",0,1
902,"Souness thanked Platini, but declined the offer, citing dressing room harmony as his reason.",his,"0: Souness, 1: Platini, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""his"" refers to Souness for the following reasons:

1. Souness is the subject of the sentence and the main actor performing the actions (thanking and declining).
2. The pronoun ""his"" is used in the context of explaining Souness's reason for declining the offer.
3. It would not make sense for ""his"" to refer to Platini, as Platini is not the one declining the offer or citing a reason.
4. The phrase ""dressing room harmony"" is more likely to be a concern for Souness, who is implied to be in a position of authority (likely a coach or manager), rather than Platini, who is making an offer.

Therefore, the pronoun ""his"" clearly refers to Souness in this context.",0,0
903,"While Mark deliberates whether to trust Dimble, he is found by police and arrested for Hingest's murder.",he,"0: Mark, 1: Dimble, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Mark for the following reasons:

1. Mark is the subject of the first part of the sentence, making him the most prominent character in the context.
2. The sentence structure suggests that the same person who is deliberating (Mark) is also the one who is found and arrested.
3. The action of being found and arrested logically follows the deliberation about trusting Dimble, indicating a continuation of events related to Mark.
4. There is no indication in the sentence that the subject changes from Mark to Dimble.

Therefore, based on the context and sentence structure, ""he"" most likely refers to Mark.",0,0
904,"Emperor Taizong spared Ashina Duobi but he detained him at Chang ` an, and he considered what to do with the Eastern Tujue people.",him,"0: Emperor Taizong, 1: Ashina Duobi, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""him"" refers to Ashina Duobi. The sentence structure indicates that Emperor Taizong took an action towards Ashina Duobi, which was detaining him at Chang'an. The pronoun ""him"" is used to avoid repeating Ashina Duobi's name in the same sentence. It's clear that Emperor Taizong is the subject performing the action, and Ashina Duobi is the object being detained, so ""him"" must refer to Ashina Duobi.",0,1
905,"The major-general was named as one of the king's judges, but, like Fairfax, did not take his place.",his,"0: the king, 1: The major-general, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""his"" most likely refers to ""The major-general"" for the following reasons:

1. The major-general is the main subject of the sentence and is mentioned first.
2. The phrase ""did not take his place"" is directly connected to the action of being named as one of the king's judges, which is attributed to the major-general.
3. The king is mentioned only in a possessive form (""king's judges"") and is not the primary actor in the sentence.
4. The comparison with Fairfax (""like Fairfax"") suggests that the major-general's action is being described, not the king's.

Therefore, ""his"" in this context refers to the major-general's place as one of the king's judges, which he did not take.",1,1
906,"Calchas could n't equal Mopsus' skills as a seer, being a son of Apollo and Manto, so he died.",he,"0: Mopsus, 1: Calchas, 2: Neither","In the given text, the pronoun 'he' refers to Calchas. The sentence structure indicates that Calchas is the subject who couldn't equal Mopsus' skills and consequently died. The phrase 'so he died' is directly connected to Calchas' inability to match Mopsus' abilities as a seer. Therefore, 'he' in this context refers to Calchas.",1,1
907,"Charles becomes suspicious of Brian, but he keeps his thoughts to himself.",his,"0: Charles, 1: Brian, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""his"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence has two subjects: Charles and Brian.
2. The pronoun ""his"" is used in the second part of the sentence, after the comma.
3. The phrase ""keeps his thoughts to himself"" is more likely to refer to the person who becomes suspicious, rather than the person being suspected.
4. Charles is the subject who becomes suspicious of Brian.

Based on this analysis, it's more logical that ""his"" refers to Charles, as he is the one who has become suspicious and would be keeping his thoughts to himself about his suspicions.",0,0
908,"Paul Scofield was Lean's first choice for the part of Shaughnessy, but he was unable to escape a theatre commitment.",he,"0: Lean, 1: Paul Scofield, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Paul Scofield. The sentence structure indicates that Paul Scofield was considered for a part but couldn't take it due to a prior commitment. The pronoun ""he"" is used to refer back to Paul Scofield in the second part of the sentence, explaining why he couldn't take the role. Lean is mentioned as the person making the choice, but is not the subject of the inability to escape a commitment.",1,1
909,"Hinckley did not hit Reagan directly, but he seriously wounded him when a bullet ricocheted off the side of the presidential limousine and hit him in the chest.",him,"0: Hinckley, 1: Reagan, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""him"" appears twice. Let's analyze each occurrence:

1. First ""him"": ""...but he seriously wounded him...""
   This ""him"" clearly refers to Reagan, as Hinckley is the one who wounded Reagan.

2. Second ""him"": ""...and hit him in the chest.""
   This ""him"" also refers to Reagan, as it's describing where Reagan was hit by the ricocheted bullet.

Both instances of ""him"" in this sentence refer to Reagan, not Hinckley. The sentence is describing how Hinckley's actions affected Reagan, making Reagan the object (him) of Hinckley's actions.",1,1
910,Nathan warns Vince that if he does n't return the money he will tell Rod.,he,"0: Nathan, 1: Vince, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. Nathan is the subject of the main clause, warning Vince.
2. The pronoun ""he"" appears in the subordinate clause ""if he doesn't return the money.""
3. Logically, Nathan would be warning Vince about Vince's own actions, not Nathan's.
4. The consequence ""he will tell Rod"" also makes more sense if it refers to Nathan telling Rod about Vince not returning the money.

Given this analysis, it's most likely that ""he"" refers to Vince, as Nathan is warning Vince about the consequences of Vince's potential actions (not returning the money).",1,1
911,"Kuwabara is friends with Toya Meijin, but rivals Ogata, whose challenge he defeats.",he,"0: Kuwabara, 1: Toya Meijin, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Kuwabara"" as the main subject.
2. It mentions that Kuwabara is friends with Toya Meijin.
3. The sentence then introduces a new clause about Kuwabara's rivalry with Ogata.
4. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the context of defeating Ogata's challenge.

Given this structure, it's most likely that ""he"" refers to Kuwabara for the following reasons:
- Kuwabara is the main subject of the sentence.
- The pronoun is used in a clause that continues to describe Kuwabara's actions (defeating a rival's challenge).
- There's no shift in focus to Toya Meijin that would warrant using ""he"" to refer to him.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Kuwabara.",1,0
912,"Gullit was replaced by Bruce Arena, but he was not able to lead LA into a play-off spot, for the third-straight season.",he,"0: Gullit, 1: Bruce Arena, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Bruce Arena. The context suggests that Bruce Arena replaced Gullit, and then the sentence continues to describe what happened after this replacement. The phrase ""but he was not able to lead LA into a play-off spot"" is describing Bruce Arena's performance after taking over from Gullit. It wouldn't make sense for ""he"" to refer to Gullit, as Gullit had already been replaced at this point in the narrative.",0,1
913,"Paul tries to comfort Zack, but he rejects him and heads back to base with the intent to DOR himself.",he,"0: Paul, 1: Zack, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Zack. We can determine this based on the context:

1. Paul is trying to comfort Zack.
2. ""He"" rejects ""him"" - this indicates that Zack is rejecting Paul's attempt to comfort him.
3. ""He"" then heads back to base with the intent to DOR himself. DOR likely stands for ""Drop on Request,"" which is a military term for voluntarily leaving a training program. This action aligns more with Zack's state of mind, as he's the one being comforted and potentially struggling.

Therefore, ""he"" in this context refers to Zack, not Paul.",1,1
914,"Sam arrives and tries to speak to Dom again, but he does not want to see him, and asks him to leave.",he,"0: Sam, 1: Dom, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. ""Sam arrives and tries to speak to Dom again"" - This sets up the initial action.
2. ""but he does not want to see him"" - This is where the pronoun ""he"" appears.
3. ""and asks him to leave"" - This provides additional context.

The key is to determine who ""does not want to see"" whom. Given the context:

- Sam is trying to speak to Dom again, implying Sam is the one initiating the interaction.
- The person referred to by ""he"" doesn't want to see the other person.
- This person also asks the other to leave.

These actions (not wanting to see Sam and asking Sam to leave) are more likely to be performed by Dom, as Sam is the one trying to initiate contact. Therefore, ""he"" in this context most likely refers to Dom.",1,1
915,Juliana did n't trust Katie when she drunk alcohol hence they had made the pact.,she,"0: Juliana, 1: Katie, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Katie. The context suggests that Juliana doesn't trust Katie when Katie drinks alcohol. This interpretation makes the most sense because:

1. The sentence structure implies that Juliana is the subject who doesn't trust someone else (Katie) under certain conditions.
2. It's more logical that Juliana wouldn't trust Katie when Katie is drinking, rather than Juliana not trusting Katie when Juliana herself is drinking.
3. The mention of ""they had made the pact"" further supports this interpretation, suggesting that Juliana and Katie made an agreement, possibly related to Katie's alcohol consumption.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" in this context refers to Katie (candidate 1).",1,1
916,"James invites Jordan to a three-on-three match but when he declines, he questions his loss of talent.",he,"0: Jordan, 1: James, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""he"" refers to. Let's break it down:

1. James invites Jordan to a match.
2. Jordan declines the invitation.
3. Someone questions the loss of talent.

The pronoun ""he"" in the second part of the sentence (""he questions his loss of talent"") is more likely to refer to James for the following reasons:

1. James is the subject of the first action (inviting), which makes him the more prominent actor in the sentence.
2. It's more natural for the person who extended the invitation (James) to question the other person's (Jordan's) decision to decline, rather than Jordan questioning his own decision.
3. The phrase ""loss of talent"" implies that the person being referred to (Jordan) used to have talent but may have lost it, and it's more likely for James to make this judgment about Jordan than for Jordan to make it about himself.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to James.",1,1
917,"Bill Murray was considered for the role of Pat Healy, but the Farrelly brothers thought he was too old for the part.",he,"0: Bill Murray, 1: Pat Healy, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Bill Murray. The sentence is discussing Bill Murray being considered for a role, and then states that ""he"" was thought to be too old for the part. This ""he"" logically refers back to Bill Murray, as the sentence is about his potential casting and the reason he wasn't chosen. Pat Healy is mentioned only as the name of the role, not as a person being considered for casting.",0,0
918,"Poulidor was no match for Merckx, although he offered much resistance.",he,"0: Poulidor, 1: Merckx, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Poulidor. The context suggests that Poulidor was not as strong as Merckx, but still put up a fight. The phrase ""he offered much resistance"" is describing Poulidor's actions, not Merckx's. Therefore, ""he"" is referring to Poulidor.",0,0
919,John Kennedy had a speech drafted calling for the censure of McCarthy but he never delivered it.,he,"0: McCarthy, 1: John Kennedy, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to John Kennedy. The sentence structure indicates that John Kennedy is the main subject who had a speech drafted but didn't deliver it. The pronoun ""he"" is used to avoid repeating John Kennedy's name in the second part of the sentence. McCarthy is mentioned only as the subject of the potential censure, not as the person who had the speech or didn't deliver it.",1,1
920,Moco's thug captures Azul on the street but let him go when he learns that the case he is carrying contains only a guitar.,him,"0: Moco 's thug, 1: Azul, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""him"" refers to, let's analyze the sentence:

""Moco's thug captures Azul on the street but let him go when he learns that the case he is carrying contains only a guitar.""

In this sentence, ""him"" clearly refers to Azul for the following reasons:
1. Azul is the object of the action ""captures"" performed by Moco's thug.
2. The pronoun ""him"" is used in the phrase ""let him go,"" which logically follows the capture of Azul.
3. The sentence structure indicates that the person being let go is the same person who was captured, which is Azul.

Moco's thug is the subject performing the actions (capturing and letting go), so ""him"" cannot refer to the thug.

Therefore, the pronoun ""him"" refers to Azul, which is candidate 1.",1,1
921,"Paul said Rodman was selfish about rebounding, but he deemed him a hard worker and coachable.",him,"0: Paul, 1: Rodman, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""him"" refers to, let's analyze the sentence:

1. The sentence structure suggests that Paul is speaking about Rodman.
2. ""him"" is used in the latter part of the sentence, referring to the person being described.
3. The descriptions ""a hard worker and coachable"" are being applied to the person referred to as ""him"".
4. These descriptions are more likely to be about Rodman, as Paul is the one making the statement about someone else.

Given this analysis, it's clear that ""him"" refers to Rodman, not Paul.",1,1
922,"A king of the Skookum Benches offers a large sum for possession of Buck, but Thornton has grown fond of him and declines.",him,"0: A king of the Skookum Benches, 1: Buck, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""him"" refers to Buck. The context suggests that Thornton has grown fond of Buck and declines to sell him, even when offered a large sum. The king of the Skookum Benches is mentioned as the one making the offer, but he is not the subject of Thornton's fondness or the one being declined for sale. Therefore, ""him"" clearly refers to Buck.",1,1
923,"Kracklite becomes obsessed with the historical Caesar Augustus after hearing that Livia, his wife, supposedly poisoned him.",him,"0: Kracklite, 1: the historical Caesar Augustus, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""him"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions two male individuals: Kracklite and Caesar Augustus.
2. The pronoun ""him"" appears at the end of the sentence, referring to the person who was supposedly poisoned.
3. The sentence states that Livia, who is described as ""his wife,"" supposedly poisoned ""him.""
4. Given the historical context, Livia is known to be the wife of Caesar Augustus, not Kracklite.
5. The sentence is about Kracklite becoming obsessed with Caesar Augustus after hearing about the poisoning.

Based on these points, it's clear that ""him"" refers to Caesar Augustus, as he is the one who was supposedly poisoned by his wife, Livia. Kracklite is the subject of the sentence who becomes obsessed with this historical information.",1,1
924,"The United States president is aware of the Kingpin's crimes, but has never been able to prove his involvement.",his,"0: the Kingpin, 1: The United States president, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""his"" refers to the Kingpin, not the United States president. The context suggests that the president is aware of the Kingpin's crimes but has been unable to prove the Kingpin's involvement. The possessive pronoun ""his"" is used to indicate the Kingpin's involvement in the crimes, not the president's. Therefore, the correct referent for ""his"" is the Kingpin.",1,0
925,"Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri was among the few people in the government in support of Banisadr, but he was soon stripped of his powers.",he,"0: Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri, 1: Banisadr, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions two individuals: Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri and Banisadr.
2. The pronoun ""he"" appears in the second part of the sentence, after the comma.
3. The clause ""but he was soon stripped of his powers"" is more likely to refer to the main subject of the sentence, which is Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri.
4. Montazeri is described as being ""among the few people in the government in support of Banisadr,"" which sets him up as the primary actor in this sentence.
5. The use of ""but"" indicates a contrast to the previous statement, suggesting that despite Montazeri's support for Banisadr, it was Montazeri himself who faced consequences.

Based on these observations, it is most logical that ""he"" refers to Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri, not Banisadr.",1,"0

The context suggests that Golan Cipel was appointed as homeland security adviser by McGreevey, and the criticism was due to Cipel's lack of experience or qualifications for the position. The pronoun ""he"" is used to describe the person who lacked experience, which logically refers to Cipel, not McGreevey who did the appointing.",1,1
927,"Initially, then Minister of Defense Pinhas Lavon refused to release Zichroni, though he was eventually discharged from the army reserves.",he,"0: Zichroni, 1: Minister of Defense Pinhas Lavon, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Zichroni. The context suggests that Zichroni was the person who was initially not released by Minister of Defense Pinhas Lavon, but was eventually discharged from the army reserves. The sentence structure and logic indicate that ""he"" is the subject of being discharged, which aligns with Zichroni's situation rather than Lavon's position as the Minister of Defense.",1,0
928,"The king planned to arrest Pausanias in the street, but he was warned of this plan and escaped to the temple of Athena of the Brazen House.",he,"0: Pausanias, 1: The king, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and logical flow of the sentence:

1. The sentence starts with ""The king planned to arrest Pausanias.""
2. Then it mentions ""but he was warned of this plan.""
3. The person who would be warned of the arrest plan would logically be the one being targeted for arrest, not the one planning the arrest.
4. The sentence continues with ""and escaped to the temple,"" which further confirms that this person was trying to avoid being arrested.

Given this analysis, it's clear that ""he"" refers to Pausanias, as he is the one who would be warned about the arrest plan and subsequently escape to avoid it. The king, being the one planning the arrest, would not need to be warned or escape.",0,0
929,"Henchard feels threatened by Farfrae, particularly when Elizabeth-Jane starts to fall in love with him.",him,"0: Henchard, 1: Farfrae, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""him"" most likely refers to Farfrae for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure suggests that Henchard is the subject feeling threatened by Farfrae.
2. The pronoun ""him"" appears at the end of the sentence, referring to the person Elizabeth-Jane is falling in love with.
3. It would be illogical for Elizabeth-Jane to fall in love with Henchard if he's the one feeling threatened, as the sentence implies a contrast between Henchard's feelings and Elizabeth-Jane's romantic interest.
4. The use of ""particularly when"" indicates that Elizabeth-Jane's romantic interest in Farfrae is an additional factor contributing to Henchard's feeling of being threatened.

Therefore, ""him"" in this context refers to Farfrae (candidate 1).",0,1
930,Gareth was knighted by Lancelot himself when he took upon him the adventure on behalf of Dame Lynette.,he,"0: Gareth, 1: Lancelot, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Gareth was knighted by Lancelot...""
2. The pronoun ""he"" appears in the clause ""...when he took upon him the adventure...""
3. The action of taking upon an adventure is more likely to be associated with the person being knighted (Gareth) rather than the one doing the knighting (Lancelot).
4. The phrase ""on behalf of Dame Lynette"" further supports that it was Gareth who took on the adventure, as it's common in chivalric tales for knights to undertake quests for ladies.

Given this analysis, it's most logical that ""he"" refers to Gareth, who was being knighted and then took on an adventure.",1,0
931,Mayor Riley supported Menotti so strongly that he threatened to withdraw city support for the festival if Menotti were pushed out.,he,"0: Menotti, 1: Mayor Riley, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Mayor Riley. The context indicates that Mayor Riley is the one who supported Menotti and threatened to withdraw city support for the festival. The pronoun ""he"" is used to describe the person taking these actions, which is clearly Mayor Riley, not Menotti.",1,1
932,"Arnold Schwarzenegger endorsed Taliaferro for re-election, but Broward soon entered the race against him.",him,"0: Taliaferro, 1: Arnold Schwarzenegger, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""him"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. Arnold Schwarzenegger is mentioned first, endorsing Taliaferro.
2. Taliaferro is the subject of the endorsement.
3. Broward is mentioned as entering the race against ""him"".

The pronoun ""him"" is used in the context of someone running against in an election. Since Taliaferro is mentioned as being up for re-election, it's most logical that Broward would be entering the race against Taliaferro, not against Arnold Schwarzenegger (who is not mentioned as a candidate).

Therefore, ""him"" most likely refers to Taliaferro.",1,0
933,"Paul offers to accompany Seth, but he declines and gives him some cash before they go their separate ways.",he,"0: Paul, 1: Seth, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Paul offers to accompany Seth.
2. ""He"" declines the offer.
3. ""He"" gives ""him"" some cash.

The pronoun ""he"" is performing the actions of declining and giving cash. Since Paul is the one offering to accompany Seth, it makes sense that Seth would be the one declining the offer. Additionally, the use of ""him"" later in the sentence suggests that Seth is giving cash to Paul, further confirming that ""he"" refers to Seth.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Seth.",1,1
934,"Enraged, Harry tries to strangle Johnny, but he can not bring himself to kill him.",him,"0: Johnny, 1: Harry, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who the pronoun ""him"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Harry is trying to strangle Johnny.
2. The pronoun ""him"" appears in the phrase ""can not bring himself to kill him.""

Given this information, we can deduce that ""him"" refers to Johnny for the following reasons:
- Harry is the subject performing the action (trying to strangle).
- Johnny is the object receiving the action (being strangled).
- The phrase ""can not bring himself to kill him"" implies that Harry is unable to complete the action of killing someone else, which would be Johnny in this context.

Therefore, the pronoun ""him"" refers to Johnny, not Harry.",0,0
935,"Ibn Kathir began an explanation of Sahih Al-Bukhari, but he did not finish it.",he,"0: Ibn Kathir, 1: Sahih Al-Bukhari, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" clearly refers to Ibn Kathir. The sentence is describing an action that Ibn Kathir took (beginning an explanation) and then did not complete. Sahih Al-Bukhari is the object of the explanation, not the subject performing the action. Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" must refer to Ibn Kathir.",0,0
936,"Masuo tries repeatedly to court Jean, but every time he seems to make progress, something inevitably goes wrong.",he,"0: Masuo, 1: Jean, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" clearly refers to Masuo. The sentence describes Masuo's actions in trying to court Jean. The pronoun ""he"" is used to continue referring to Masuo as the subject of the sentence, describing his attempts and the outcomes. Jean is mentioned as the object of Masuo's courtship efforts, not as the subject performing the action.",0,0
937,"John is unable to find Fred, but Dede discovers him back at their apartment and embraces him.",him,"0: John, 1: Fred, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. ""John is unable to find Fred"" - This establishes that John is looking for Fred.
2. ""but Dede discovers him"" - The pronoun ""him"" is used here, referring to someone who was discovered.
3. ""back at their apartment"" - This suggests that the person discovered was in a place associated with both John and Fred (and possibly Dede).
4. ""and embraces him"" - Dede embraces the person who was discovered.

Given this context, it's most logical that ""him"" refers to Fred, not John. The reasons are:

1. John was the one searching, so he wouldn't need to be ""discovered.""
2. Fred was the one being searched for, so it makes sense that he would be the one ""discovered.""
3. The act of embracing suggests a reunion, which aligns with Fred being found after being missing.

Therefore, the pronoun ""him"" most likely refers to Fred.",1,1
938,"Dietrich missed Jad, but Jad did not miss Dietrich, killing him.",him,"0: Dietrich, 1: Jad, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. ""Dietrich missed Jad"" - This establishes that Dietrich has feelings for Jad.
2. ""but Jad did not miss Dietrich"" - This shows that Jad does not reciprocate those feelings.
3. ""killing him"" - This is the key part where we need to determine who ""him"" refers to.

Given the context, it's more logical that ""him"" refers to Dietrich for the following reasons:
- The sentence structure suggests a contrast between Dietrich's feelings and Jad's actions.
- It would be unusual for Jad to kill himself in this context.
- The lack of reciprocal feelings from Jad towards Dietrich sets up a potential motive for Jad to harm Dietrich.

Therefore, the pronoun ""him"" most likely refers to Dietrich.",0,0
939,"Knuckles defeats Thrash, but ultimately fail to prevent him from escaping, and thus lost his chance to bring his people back.",him,"0: Knuckles, 1: Thrash, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""him"" refers to Thrash. The context indicates that Knuckles defeats Thrash but fails to prevent Thrash from escaping. The pronoun ""him"" is used in the phrase ""prevent him from escaping,"" which logically refers to Thrash, as Knuckles is trying to prevent Thrash's escape, not his own.",1,1
940,"Akiyama then contacted the Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Theodore Roosevelt, but his pleas to be allowed to attend the Naval War College were refused.",his,"0: Akiyama, 1: Theodore Roosevelt, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""his"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence starts with ""Akiyama,"" indicating he is the main subject.
2. Akiyama is the one who contacted Theodore Roosevelt.
3. The pronoun ""his"" is used in the phrase ""his pleas,"" which refers to the person making the pleas.
4. It makes logical sense that Akiyama would be the one pleading to attend the Naval War College, not Theodore Roosevelt who was in a position of authority as the Assistant Secretary of the Navy.

Based on these points, it is clear that ""his"" refers to Akiyama, not Theodore Roosevelt.",1,0
941,Daredevil scans the prisoner Mueller and he finds not three but dozens of murders he committed.,he,"0: Daredevil, 1: the prisoner Mueller, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which person ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Daredevil is the subject of the first part of the sentence, performing the action of scanning.
2. The prisoner Mueller is the object being scanned.
3. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the second part of the sentence, where the action is finding murders.

Given the structure of the sentence, it's more logical that ""he"" refers to Daredevil, the subject of the sentence. It makes more sense that Daredevil, who is doing the scanning, would be the one to find the murders committed by Mueller. If ""he"" referred to Mueller, the sentence structure would be awkward and unclear.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Daredevil.",1,0
942,"Lochley wants to ask President Sheridan, but Delenn says she has already discussed it with him, and he agrees.",him,"0: Lochley, 1: President Sheridan, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""him"" clearly refers to President Sheridan. The context indicates that Delenn has already discussed something with ""him,"" and given that President Sheridan is the only male individual mentioned in the text, it's logical to conclude that ""him"" refers to President Sheridan. Lochley is mentioned as wanting to ask President Sheridan something, and Delenn states she has already talked to ""him"" about it, further confirming that ""him"" refers to President Sheridan.",0,1
943,The kid finds the restaurant where Mike was supposed to take Chris to and discover he is there with another girl.,he,"0: The kid, 1: Mike, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. The pronoun ""he"" is singular and masculine, so it refers to a male individual.
2. We have two male candidates: ""The kid"" and ""Mike"".
3. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" is referring to someone who is at the restaurant.
4. The sentence states that ""The kid finds the restaurant where Mike was supposed to take Chris to and discover he is there with another girl.""
5. The phrase ""he is there"" implies that the person being referred to is at the restaurant.
6. Given the context, it's more logical that Mike is the one at the restaurant with another girl, not the kid who just found the restaurant.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Mike.",1,1
944,"Andre is desired by Eliot, but all he is interested in is money.",he,"0: Andre, 1: Eliot, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, let's analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence has two parts separated by ""but"":
   - ""Andre is desired by Eliot""
   - ""all he is interested in is money""

2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the second part of the sentence.

3. The structure suggests that ""he"" is contrasting with the subject of the first part (Andre).

4. It would be more natural to use ""he"" to refer to Andre, as Andre is the main subject of the sentence.

5. The sentence implies that while Eliot desires Andre, Andre (referred to as ""he"") is only interested in money.

Based on this analysis, it's most likely that ""he"" refers to Andre.",0,0
945,"Gareth overcomes the Green Knight, but spares his life in return for the knight's swearing to serve him.",his,"0: Gareth, 1: the Green Knight, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""his"" is used in the phrase ""spares his life."" To determine which candidate this pronoun refers to, we need to consider the context and logic of the sentence.

1. Gareth is the subject of the sentence and the one performing the actions.
2. The Green Knight is the object of Gareth's actions.
3. The sentence states that Gareth ""spares his life.""

It wouldn't make sense for Gareth to spare his own life, as he is not in danger. Instead, it's logical that Gareth would spare the life of the person he has overcome, which is the Green Knight. Therefore, ""his"" in this context refers to the Green Knight's life.",1,1
946,"Celine attempts to contact the resurrected Juliana, but seeing she has no memory of her previous life, she decides to leave her alone.",she,"0: Celine, 1: the resurrected Juliana, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""she"" refers to: Celine or the resurrected Juliana. Let's break down the sentence:

1. Celine attempts to contact the resurrected Juliana
2. But seeing she has no memory of her previous life
3. She decides to leave her alone

The pronoun ""she"" in question is the subject of the clause ""she has no memory of her previous life."" This clearly refers to the resurrected Juliana, not Celine. It wouldn't make sense for Celine to have no memory of her previous life in this context.

Furthermore, this lack of memory is the reason why Celine decides to leave her (Juliana) alone. Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" in this sentence refers to the resurrected Juliana.",1,1
947,"Freya is attracted to Julie, although her symbiote prefers Daniel Jackson.",her,"0: Freya, 1: Julie, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""her"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions two female names: Freya and Julie.
2. The pronoun ""her"" is used in the clause ""her symbiote prefers Daniel Jackson.""
3. The sentence structure suggests that ""her"" is referring to the subject of the main clause, which is Freya.
4. It's more logical that Freya would have a symbiote, as she is the main subject of the sentence, and the information about the symbiote is presented as additional information about her.
5. Julie is mentioned as the object of Freya's attraction, making it less likely that ""her"" refers to Julie.

Based on this analysis, it's most probable that ""her"" refers to Freya.",0,0
948,Van Helsing continues to hypnotize Mark but his ability to have influence over him diminishes each day.,his,"0: Mark, 1: Van Helsing, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""his"" refers to Van Helsing. The context suggests that Van Helsing is the one performing the action of hypnotizing Mark, and it is Van Helsing's ability to influence Mark that is diminishing. The sentence structure indicates that ""his"" is referring to the subject of the sentence (Van Helsing) rather than the object (Mark).",1,1
949,"Montholon is known to have despised and flouted Las Cases, though in later writings he affected to laud his services to Napoleon.",he,"0: Montholon, 1: Las Cases, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence begins with ""Montholon,"" making him the primary subject.
2. The pronoun ""he"" appears in the phrase ""he affected to laud his services to Napoleon.""
3. This action of ""affecting to laud"" is contrasted with the earlier statement that Montholon ""despised and flouted Las Cases.""
4. It would be illogical for Las Cases to laud his own services, especially in the context of being despised by Montholon.
5. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" refers to the subject of the main clause, which is Montholon.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Montholon, who, despite his earlier contempt for Las Cases, later pretended to praise Las Cases' services to Napoleon in his writings.",0,0
950,"Marcus learns from von Hammersmark, after he forcefully interrogates him, that Hitler will attend the premiere and decides to continue the mission.",him,"0: Marcus, 1: von Hammersmark, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""him"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions two people: Marcus and von Hammersmark.
2. The pronoun ""him"" is used in the phrase ""after he forcefully interrogates him"".
3. The subject of the sentence is Marcus, who is performing the action of learning and interrogating.
4. The pronoun ""he"" in this phrase refers to Marcus, as he is the one doing the interrogating.
5. Therefore, the pronoun ""him"" must refer to the person being interrogated, which is von Hammersmark.

Based on this analysis, we can conclude that ""him"" refers to von Hammersmark.",0,1
951,"Conan was a legitimate contender for the title of Duke of Normandy, so he became a serious rival to Duke William.",he,"0: Conan, 1: Duke of Normandy, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Conan. The sentence structure indicates that Conan is the subject of both clauses. The first clause establishes Conan as a contender for the title of Duke of Normandy, and the second clause, connected by ""so,"" continues to describe Conan's status as a rival to Duke William. The pronoun ""he"" is used to avoid repeating Conan's name in the second part of the sentence. Therefore, ""he"" clearly refers to Conan and not to the Duke of Normandy or any other entity.",0,0
952,"The next day Lou Piniella announced that when Zambrano returned, he would be moved back to the bullpen.",he,"0: Zambrano, 1: Lou Piniella, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Zambrano. The context indicates that Lou Piniella is making an announcement about Zambrano's future role in the team. Specifically, the sentence states that ""when Zambrano returned, he would be moved back to the bullpen."" This clearly shows that ""he"" is referring to Zambrano, as he is the one who will be returning and being moved to the bullpen. Lou Piniella is the one making the announcement, not the subject of the action.",0,0
953,"Aubrey wants to marry Sophia, but she delays making a firm engagement.",she,"0: Aubrey, 1: Sophia, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence presents two people: Aubrey and Sophia.
2. The main clause states that ""Aubrey wants to marry Sophia.""
3. The second part of the sentence, connected by ""but,"" introduces an action: ""she delays making a firm engagement.""

Given this structure, it's more likely that ""she"" refers to Aubrey for the following reasons:
- Aubrey is the subject of the main clause and the primary actor in the sentence.
- The action of delaying an engagement logically follows from Aubrey's desire to marry Sophia.
- It would be less coherent for Sophia to be delaying the engagement when Aubrey is the one described as wanting to marry her.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Aubrey.",1,0
954,"Felicia tried to wish Megan to go away, but instead she accidentally caused the key to create a massive explosion.",she,"0: Felicia, 1: Megan, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Felicia is the subject of the main clause and the one performing the action of trying to wish.
2. Megan is the object of Felicia's wish.
3. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the second part of the sentence, describing an accidental action.

Given that Felicia is the main actor in the sentence and the one initiating the action, it's most logical that ""she"" refers to Felicia. The accidental causing of the explosion is a continuation of Felicia's actions, not Megan's.

Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Felicia.",0,0
955,Meryl Streep was also offered the part of Michelle but declined because she did n't like the tone of the film.,she,"0: Michelle, 1: Meryl Streep, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" clearly refers to Meryl Streep. The sentence is discussing Meryl Streep's decision to decline a role, and the pronoun ""she"" is used to refer back to Meryl Streep as the subject of the action (not liking the tone of the film). Michelle is mentioned only as the character in the part that was offered, not as the person making the decision.",0,1
956,"Dumbledore covers up for Harry, but he escapes as Fudge orders his arrest.",his,"0: Dumbledore, 1: Harry, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""his"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Dumbledore is covering up for Harry.
2. Someone escapes as Fudge orders an arrest.

The pronoun ""his"" is most likely referring to Harry for the following reasons:
1. The sentence structure suggests that the person escaping is the same person Dumbledore is covering up for, which is Harry.
2. It would make more sense for Fudge to order Harry's arrest rather than Dumbledore's, given that Dumbledore is a respected figure and Harry is often in trouble.
3. The use of ""but"" indicates a contrast between Dumbledore's action (covering up) and what follows (escape and arrest order), implying that these actions relate to different people.

Therefore, the pronoun ""his"" most likely refers to Harry.",1,1
957,"Samantha shows some hostility towards Brenda, mostly because she is an American.",she,"0: Samantha, 1: Brenda, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""she"" is the reason for Samantha's hostility towards Brenda.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used to refer to the person who is American.
3. Since Samantha is showing hostility towards Brenda because of this characteristic, it's more likely that Brenda is the American being referred to.
4. It wouldn't make sense for Samantha to show hostility towards Brenda because Samantha herself is American.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Brenda.",1,1
958,"Millie begins to fall for Julie, but she sees her summon Miss Dorothy from her room for a late night rendezvous, and assumes the worst.",her,"0: Millie, 1: Julie, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""her"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Millie begins to fall for Julie"".
2. Then it says ""but she sees her summon Miss Dorothy"".
3. The pronoun ""she"" likely refers to Millie, as she is the subject of the sentence and the one experiencing the action (falling for Julie and seeing something).
4. The pronoun ""her"" in question is the object of the verb ""sees"" and the subject of ""summon"".
5. Given the context, it makes more sense that Julie is the one summoning Miss Dorothy, not Millie.

Therefore, the pronoun ""her"" most likely refers to Julie.",1,1
959,Hunter becomes increasingly impressed with Batman but he is still able to pull off his crime.,his,"0: Batman, 1: Hunter, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""his"" refers to - Batman or Hunter. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Hunter becomes increasingly impressed with Batman.""
2. The second part of the sentence uses ""he"" and ""his"" to refer to someone who is able to pull off a crime.

Given that Hunter is the subject of the first part of the sentence and is described as being impressed with Batman, it's more logical that Hunter would be the one pulling off a crime. Batman, being a superhero, is typically not associated with committing crimes.

Therefore, ""his"" in this context most likely refers to Hunter, as he is the one who is able to pull off the crime despite being impressed by Batman.",0,1
960,"Kennedy wanted the seat to go to younger brother Edward, but he was ineligible due to age at the time of the appointment.",he,"0: younger brother Edward, 1: Kennedy, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to ""younger brother Edward"" for the following reasons:

1. The sentence is discussing the eligibility for a seat, which Kennedy wanted to go to Edward.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the context of being ""ineligible due to age at the time of the appointment.""
3. It's more logical that Edward would be ineligible due to age, rather than Kennedy, who is presumably older and already in a position to want the seat to go to someone else.
4. The phrase ""younger brother Edward"" immediately precedes the pronoun ""he,"" making it the most recent and relevant subject for the pronoun to refer to.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Edward, not Kennedy.",0,0
961,"Henry tries to reconcile with Steven, but he does not let him in, giving him a hard interrogation instead.",he,"0: Henry, 1: Steven, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""he"" refers to: Henry or Steven. Let's break it down:

1. ""Henry tries to reconcile with Steven"" - This establishes Henry as the active party, trying to make amends.
2. ""but he does not let him in"" - This is the key part. The ""he"" here is performing an action (not letting someone in) that opposes Henry's attempt to reconcile.
3. ""giving him a hard interrogation instead"" - This further confirms that the ""he"" is acting against Henry's interests.

Given this analysis, it's clear that the ""he"" in question is Steven. Steven is the one not letting Henry in and giving him a hard interrogation. This makes sense in the context of Henry trying to reconcile, but Steven resisting and instead interrogating Henry.",1,1
962,"Jennifer did not begin playing Ingrid until the character's second appearance; the first time the character appeared, she was played by Ashley Jones.",she,"0: Ingrid, 1: Jennifer, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence mentions two people: Jennifer and Ingrid.
2. It states that Jennifer did not begin playing Ingrid until the character's second appearance.
3. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""she was played by Ashley Jones.""

Given this information, we can deduce that:
- ""She"" cannot refer to Jennifer, as Jennifer is mentioned as not playing the role initially.
- ""She"" is most likely referring to Ingrid, as the sentence is discussing who played this character.
- The pronoun is used to indicate that Ingrid was played by Ashley Jones in her first appearance.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Ingrid.",0,0
963,"Jane refused to work with Serena, so she was fired and paid off.",she,"0: Jane, 1: Serena, 2: Neither","To determine who ""she"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and logical flow:

1. Jane refused to work with Serena.
2. As a result, ""she"" was fired and paid off.

The pronoun ""she"" is more likely to refer to Jane for the following reasons:

1. Jane is the subject of the first clause and the main actor in the sentence.
2. The consequence of being fired typically follows an employee's refusal to work with someone, rather than being the consequence for the person they refused to work with.
3. The phrase ""so she was fired"" implies a direct cause-and-effect relationship between the refusal to work and the firing, which logically connects to Jane's action.

Therefore, it is most probable that Jane was the one who was fired and paid off as a consequence of her refusal to work with Serena.",1,0
964,"The British not only advocated for the Native Americans, but they painted them.",they,"0: The British, 1: the Native Americans, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence has two main parts separated by ""not only... but also"" structure.
2. ""The British"" is the subject of both parts of the sentence.
3. ""The British"" is performing two actions: advocating for the Native Americans and painting them.
4. The pronoun ""they"" is used as the subject of the second action (painting).

Given this analysis, it's clear that ""they"" refers to ""The British"" because:
a) ""The British"" is the main subject of the sentence.
b) The structure of the sentence indicates that the same subject (The British) is performing both actions.
c) It wouldn't make sense for ""the Native Americans"" to be painting themselves in this context.

Therefore, the pronoun ""they"" refers to ""The British"" (candidate 0).",0,0
965,Bob quickly pulls Harold into the flat so that he will not go into his own and discover the thievery.,he,"0: Bob, 1: Harold, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Bob is the subject of the sentence and is performing the action of pulling Harold into the flat.
2. The purpose of this action is stated as ""so that he will not go into his own and discover the thievery.""

Given this context, it's more likely that ""he"" refers to Harold rather than Bob. The reasoning is:

1. Bob is actively preventing someone from going somewhere.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used to refer to the person who might ""go into his own and discover the thievery.""
3. It wouldn't make sense for Bob to prevent himself from going into his own flat.
4. Therefore, Bob must be preventing Harold from going into Harold's flat to discover some thievery.

So, ""he"" in this context refers to Harold.",1,1
966,"Henley calmed Corll, promising to participate if he is released.",he,"0: Henley, 1: Corll, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""he"" refers to. The context suggests that Henley is making a promise to Corll about participating in something if a condition is met. The condition is that ""he"" is released. 

Given the structure of the sentence, it's more logical that Henley is promising to participate if Henley himself is released, rather than if Corll is released. This is because:

1. Henley is the subject of the sentence and the one making the promise.
2. It wouldn't make sense for Henley to promise participation based on Corll's release, as Corll is the one being calmed and presumably in control of the situation.

Therefore, ""he"" most likely refers to Henley.",1,0
967,Sharapova was supposed to play Aliz Cornet but she was suffering from a viral illness.,she,"0: Sharapova, 1: Aliz Cornet, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun 'she' most likely refers to Aliz Cornet. The structure of the sentence suggests that Sharapova was supposed to play against Aliz Cornet, but Cornet was unable to play due to a viral illness. This interpretation is supported by the use of 'but' which introduces a contrasting idea to the initial statement about the planned match. It's more logical that the illness affected the opponent (Aliz Cornet) rather than Sharapova, as it explains why the match couldn't proceed as planned.",0,1
968,Police speculate that the men may have been trying to escape when they were killed.,they,"0: Police, 1: the men, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence begins with ""Police speculate,"" indicating that the police are the subject performing the action of speculating.
2. The main clause of the sentence is about ""the men"" and what may have happened to them.
3. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the subordinate clause ""when they were killed.""
4. Logically, the pronoun ""they"" refers to the individuals who were killed, which in this context are ""the men.""
5. It wouldn't make sense for ""they"" to refer to the police, as the police are not the ones being killed in this scenario.

Therefore, the pronoun ""they"" most likely refers to ""the men"" (candidate 1).",1,1
969,"Jim Carrey was originally cast as Stu Shepard, but he dropped out.",he,"0: Jim Carrey, 1: Stu Shepard, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Jim Carrey. The sentence states that Jim Carrey was originally cast as Stu Shepard, but then ""he"" dropped out. The action of dropping out is logically connected to the person who was originally cast, which is Jim Carrey. Therefore, ""he"" in this context refers to Jim Carrey (candidate 0) and not to Stu Shepard (candidate 1), who is merely the character Jim Carrey was supposed to play.",1,0
970,"Johnson was trained by Curtis Frye, at the University of South Carolina where he served as an assistant head coach.",he,"0: Johnson, 1: Curtis Frye, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions two people: Johnson and Curtis Frye.
2. The pronoun ""he"" appears in the clause ""where he served as an assistant head coach.""
3. The main subject of the sentence is Johnson, who was trained by Curtis Frye.
4. The clause with ""he"" is providing additional information about one of these individuals.

Given the structure of the sentence, it's more likely that ""he"" refers to Johnson rather than Curtis Frye. This is because:

1. Johnson is the main subject of the sentence.
2. The information about serving as an assistant head coach is presented as additional information about Johnson's background.
3. It would be grammatically awkward for ""he"" to suddenly refer to Curtis Frye in this context without a clear transition or indication.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Johnson.",0,0
971,"Johnson was trained by Curtis Frye, at the University of South Carolina where he served as a volunteer head coach.",he,"0: Johnson, 1: Curtis Frye, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions two people: Johnson and Curtis Frye.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""where he served as a volunteer head coach.""
3. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" refers to the subject of the main clause, which is Johnson.
4. It would be grammatically awkward and unclear if ""he"" referred to Curtis Frye in this context.
5. The sentence is primarily about Johnson's training and his role at the University of South Carolina.

Based on these observations, it is most logical and grammatically consistent that ""he"" refers to Johnson, who served as a volunteer head coach at the University of South Carolina.",0,0
972,"Petrarch was not able to read Plato directly, but he greatly admired him.",he,"0: Petrarch, 1: Plato, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Petrarch"" as the subject.
2. The pronoun ""he"" appears in the second part of the sentence.
3. The sentence states that ""he greatly admired him.""

Given this information, we can deduce that:
- ""Petrarch"" is the subject of the entire sentence.
- The pronoun ""he"" is most likely referring back to the subject, Petrarch.
- ""him"" at the end of the sentence is likely referring to Plato, as the object of Petrarch's admiration.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" in this sentence is most likely referring to Petrarch.",1,0
973,Leonardo wanted Edward but he lost him and married the normal Rodney Bayham.,him,"0: Leonardo, 1: Edward, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""him"" refers to Edward. The context suggests that Leonardo wanted Edward, but then lost him. The pronoun ""him"" is used to avoid repeating Edward's name. It cannot refer to Leonardo because Leonardo is the subject of the sentence, and ""him"" is being used as an object. It also doesn't make sense for Leonardo to lose himself. Therefore, ""him"" must refer to Edward.",1,1
974,"Dalia was murdered by Chrissie after she, Zoe and Sam confronted her about her manipulation of lies regarding the three of them.",she,"0: Dalia, 1: Chrissie, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Dalia was murdered by Chrissie.""
2. Then it continues with ""after she, Zoe and Sam confronted her.""

The pronoun ""she"" is used in a list with two other names (Zoe and Sam), indicating that it refers to a third person who is not Dalia or Chrissie. This is because:

a) Dalia is the victim and is not likely to confront anyone after being murdered.
b) Chrissie is the murderer and is being confronted, so she can't be part of the group doing the confronting.

Therefore, ""she"" in this context refers to neither Dalia nor Chrissie, but to a third person who is part of the group confronting Chrissie along with Zoe and Sam.",1,2
975,"Linda was played by Liza Tarbuck, well known as a television presenter rather than as an actress, although she had originally trained as such.",she,"0: Linda, 1: Liza Tarbuck, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions two people: Linda and Liza Tarbuck.
2. The pronoun ""she"" appears in the phrase ""although she had originally trained as such.""
3. This phrase is providing additional information about Liza Tarbuck, not Linda.
4. The sentence structure indicates that Liza Tarbuck is the main subject of the sentence, with Linda being mentioned as the character Liza played.
5. The information about training as an actress logically applies to Liza Tarbuck, as it's contrasting her better-known role as a television presenter.

Based on these observations, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Liza Tarbuck.",0,1
976,"Shatterstar attempts to kill Arcade, but he only destroys a robotic double.",he,"0: Arcade, 1: Shatterstar, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Shatterstar. The sentence structure indicates that Shatterstar is the subject performing the action of attempting to kill Arcade. The pronoun ""he"" is then used to continue referring to Shatterstar in the second part of the sentence, where it's stated that ""he only destroys a robotic double."" This action is a continuation of Shatterstar's attempt to kill Arcade, further confirming that ""he"" refers to Shatterstar.",0,1
977,"This was due to Joseph having discovered that Carl was still married, although having told him he had been divorced for two years.",him,"0: Joseph, 1: Carl, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""him"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions two people: Joseph and Carl.
2. The pronoun ""him"" is used in the phrase ""having told him.""
3. The sentence implies that Carl had told someone that he had been divorced for two years.
4. It makes more sense that Carl would have told Joseph about his marital status, rather than Joseph telling Carl about Carl's own marital status.

Based on this analysis, it's logical to conclude that ""him"" refers to Joseph. Carl is the one who told ""him"" (Joseph) about being divorced, which Joseph later discovered was not true.",1,0
978,"Hawley plans to accompany Emile, but first he has to end his affair with Wanda.",he,"0: Hawley, 1: Emile, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun 'he' clearly refers to Hawley.

979,"Astrov arrives and is sent for by Samuel, but the professor refuses to see him.",him,"0: Astrov, 1: Samuel, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""him"" most likely refers to Astrov. The sentence structure suggests that Astrov is the one being sent for, and then the professor refuses to see ""him"". This makes sense in the context, as Astrov is mentioned first as arriving, and then Samuel sends for him. The professor's refusal to see ""him"" logically follows as referring to Astrov, who has just arrived and been sent for.",0,0
980,"Samuel is distraught at nearly losing Phil and when he regains consciousness, he persuades him to put his anger aside and give their marriage a try.",he,"0: Samuel, 1: Phil, 2: Neither","In this sentence, there are two instances of 'he'. The first 'he' clearly refers to Samuel, as it states 'when he regains consciousness'. This implies that Samuel was the one who was unconscious. The second 'he' also refers to Samuel, as it's part of the same subject continuing the action: 'he persuades him'. Here, Samuel is persuading Phil. Therefore, the pronoun 'he' in this context refers to Samuel.",1,0
981,Shi Kefa himself was killed by the chef of the Manchus when he refused to switch his allegiance to the Qing regime.,he,"0: Shi Kefa, 1: the chef of the Manchus, 2: Neither","The pronoun ""he"" in this sentence refers to Shi Kefa for the following reasons:

1. Shi Kefa is the main subject of the sentence, introduced at the beginning.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the context of refusing to switch allegiance, which logically applies to Shi Kefa, not the chef.
3. The chef is mentioned as the agent who killed Shi Kefa, not as the one refusing to switch allegiance.
4. It makes more sense in the historical context that a person of importance (Shi Kefa) would be asked to switch allegiance, rather than a chef.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" clearly refers to Shi Kefa (candidate 0).",0,0
982,"Tamora eloquently begs for the life of Alyssa, but Titus refuses her plea.",her,"0: Tamora, 1: Alyssa, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which person the pronoun ""her"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Tamora is the subject of the sentence, performing the action of begging.
2. Alyssa is the object of Tamora's plea, as Tamora is begging for Alyssa's life.
3. The pronoun ""her"" is used in the phrase ""her plea,"" which refers to the plea made by Tamora.

Given this analysis, we can conclude that ""her"" refers to Tamora. The plea belongs to Tamora, as she is the one doing the begging. Therefore, ""her plea"" means ""Tamora's plea.""",0,0
983,"Nina still loved Candice, but she knew they had no chance at happiness.",she,"0: Nina, 1: Candice, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Nina for the following reasons:

1. Nina is mentioned first in the sentence, making her the primary subject.
2. The sentence structure suggests that Nina is the one doing the action of ""knowing,"" which is associated with the pronoun ""she.""
3. The context implies that Nina is the one who still has feelings for Candice but realizes the relationship won't work out.

While it's not impossible for ""she"" to refer to Candice, the sentence structure and context make it more likely that Nina is the subject of the second clause.",0,0
984,"Simba reluctantly agrees, but he does not trust Kovu because of his prior likeness to Scar, and continues to treat him coldly.",his,"0: Simba, 1: Kovu, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""his"" refers to Kovu, not Simba. The context indicates that Simba does not trust Kovu because of ""his prior likeness to Scar."" This likeness is attributed to Kovu, not Simba. Simba is the one who doesn't trust Kovu, so it wouldn't make sense for Simba to distrust himself due to a likeness to Scar. Therefore, ""his"" in this context refers to Kovu.",1,1
985,"Antonio tries to pay, but Pedro steps up and declares that he was there first.",he,"0: Antonio, 1: Pedro, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which person the pronoun ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Antonio tries to pay
2. Pedro steps up
3. ""he"" declares that he was there first

The pronoun ""he"" is used in the context of declaring being there first. This action is more closely associated with Pedro, who is described as stepping up. The sentence structure suggests that Pedro is taking action to assert his position, which aligns with the declaration of being there first.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Pedro.",0,1
986,Arteta was ecstatic at the prospect of partnering Alonso in midfield but his excitement was short lived.,his,"0: Arteta, 1: Alonso, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""his"" clearly refers to Arteta. The sentence structure indicates that Arteta was the one who was ecstatic about the prospect of partnering with Alonso. The excitement being described belongs to Arteta, not Alonso.

987,"Eventually, Mike finds that Jonnie was killed because he came close to finding the truth.",he,"0: Jonnie, 1: Mike, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions two people: Mike and Jonnie.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""he came close to finding the truth.""
3. The sentence states that ""Jonnie was killed because..."" which implies that the reason for Jonnie's death follows.
4. The clause ""he came close to finding the truth"" provides the reason for Jonnie's death.

Given this analysis, it's more logical that ""he"" refers to Jonnie rather than Mike. The sentence is explaining why Jonnie was killed, and it makes more sense that Jonnie was killed because Jonnie (not Mike) came close to finding the truth.",1,0
988,"James expresses romantic interest in Conan, but he rebuffs him and declares his devotion to Valeria.",he,"0: James, 1: Conan, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""he"" refers to. Let's break it down:

1. James expresses romantic interest in Conan
2. ""he"" rebuffs ""him""
3. ""he"" declares his devotion to Valeria

The pronoun ""he"" is performing the actions of rebuffing and declaring devotion. Given the context, it's clear that Conan is the one rebuffing James' romantic interest and declaring devotion to Valeria. Therefore, ""he"" refers to Conan.",1,1
989,"Cecilia was described as the most beautiful of the daughters of Melissa, who was frequently mentioned because of her beauty.",her,"0: Cecilia, 1: Melissa, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""her"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions two people: Cecilia and Melissa.
2. The pronoun ""her"" appears in the phrase ""her beauty.""
3. The sentence states that Melissa ""was frequently mentioned because of her beauty.""

The context suggests that Captain Bravo attempted to kill Kazuki, and then Tokiko found ""him"" alive. It makes more sense for Tokiko to find Kazuki alive (the intended victim) rather than Captain Bravo (the attacker). Therefore, ""him"" refers to Kazuki.",1,0
991,"Sylvio tries to kill Jake again, but he is stopped by Tim.",he,"0: Sylvio, 1: Jake, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Sylvio is trying to kill Jake.
2. ""He"" is stopped by Tim.

Given this information, it's most logical that ""he"" refers to Sylvio for the following reasons:
- Sylvio is the subject of the first clause and the active agent (the one trying to kill).
- It makes more sense that Tim would stop Sylvio (the attacker) rather than Jake (the victim).
- If ""he"" referred to Jake, the sentence would imply that Jake was trying to do something that needed to be stopped, which doesn't fit the context.

Therefore, ""he"" most likely refers to Sylvio.",1,0
992,"Starr had asked right guard Jerry Kramer whether he could get enough traction on the icy turf for a wedge play, and Kramer responded with an unequivocal yes.",he,"0: Starr, 1: right guard Jerry Kramer, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Jerry Kramer. The context indicates that Starr asked Jerry Kramer a question, and then ""he"" (Kramer) responded. This is evident from the structure of the sentence, where Kramer is the subject of the clause ""Kramer responded with an unequivocal yes."" Therefore, ""he"" in this case refers to Jerry Kramer, not Starr.",1,1
993,"Leon attempted to discourage the rioter Pancho Planes, but he entered the hall as well.",he,"0: Leon, 1: the rioter Pancho Planes, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions two individuals: Leon and Pancho Planes.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""but he entered the hall as well.""
3. The sentence structure suggests a contrast between Leon's action (attempting to discourage) and someone else's action (entering the hall).
4. Given this contrast, it's more likely that ""he"" refers to the person Leon was trying to discourage, which is Pancho Planes.
5. The phrase ""as well"" further supports this interpretation, implying that despite Leon's discouragement, Pancho Planes still entered the hall.

Based on this analysis, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Pancho Planes (the rioter).",1,1
994,"Eric is still obsessed about Oleg, but he sees him only occasionally.",him,"0: Eric, 1: Oleg, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""him"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

2. Oleg is mentioned as the person Eric is obsessed about.
3. The pronoun ""he"" in the second part of the sentence refers to Eric, as he is the main subject.
4. ""him"" is used as the object of ""sees"" in the second part of the sentence.

Given this analysis, it's clear that ""him"" refers to Oleg, not Eric. Eric (referred to as ""he"") is the one doing the seeing, while Oleg (referred to as ""him"") is the one being seen occasionally.

Therefore, the pronoun ""him"" refers to candidate 1: Oleg.",1,1
995,"Manda also attempts to apologize to Abby, but she coldly rebuffs her.",she,"0: Manda, 1: Abby, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which person the pronoun ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Manda is the subject of the first part of the sentence, attempting to apologize to Abby.
2. The pronoun ""she"" appears in the second part of the sentence, describing an action of coldly rebuffing.
3. It wouldn't make sense for Manda to coldly rebuff herself after attempting to apologize.
4. The logical interpretation is that Abby is the one who coldly rebuffs Manda's apology attempt.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" in this sentence refers to Abby, not Manda.",0,1
996,"Shemp was thrilled to be away from Healy but, as was his nature, worried incessantly about brother Moe and partner Larry.",his,"0: Shemp, 1: Healy, 2: Neither","The pronoun ""his"" in this sentence refers to Shemp for the following reasons:

1. Shemp is the subject of the sentence and the main focus of the action (being thrilled and worrying).
2. The phrase ""as was his nature"" is describing a characteristic of the person who is doing the worrying, which is Shemp.
3. The sentence structure suggests that ""his"" refers back to the subject of the sentence, which is Shemp.
4. There's no indication in the sentence that ""his"" could be referring to Healy or anyone else.

Therefore, the pronoun ""his"" most likely refers to Shemp (candidate 0).",0,0
997,"The men were able to elude the Texas Rangers until a member of their gang, Jim Murphy, turned informant.",their,"0: The men, 1: the Texas Rangers, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""their"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and grammatical structure of the sentence:

1. The pronoun ""their"" is plural, so it must refer to a plural noun.
2. The sentence mentions two groups: ""The men"" and ""the Texas Rangers.""
3. The phrase ""their gang"" implies ownership or association with a group of outlaws.
4. The context suggests that ""The men"" are the ones being pursued and are part of a gang.
5. It wouldn't make sense for ""their gang"" to refer to the Texas Rangers, as they are law enforcement, not a gang.

Based on these points, it's clear that ""their"" refers to ""The men"" who are evading the Texas Rangers. The gang belongs to these men, not to the Texas Rangers.",0,0
998,Penelope has loved Caroline but her rejection by her has turned this to hatred.,her,"0: Caroline, 1: Penelope, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""her"" the pronoun refers to. There are two instances of ""her"" in the sentence, and we need to analyze them separately.

1. The first ""her"" in ""her rejection"" refers to Penelope. This is because Penelope is the subject of the sentence and the one who has loved Caroline. The rejection is something that Penelope experiences, not something she does.

2. The second ""her"" in ""by her"" refers to Caroline. This is because Caroline is the object of Penelope's love, and logically, Caroline would be the one rejecting Penelope.

Given that the question asks about ""her"" without specifying which instance, and the candidates are presented as ""0: Caroline, 1: Penelope"", we need to choose the most prominent or recent reference. In this case, the most recent and clear reference is to Caroline, who is doing the rejecting.

Therefore, the pronoun ""her"" most likely refers to Caroline.",1,0
999,"Bubbles turns himself in to the police and tries to hang himself, but he survives and is taken to a detox facility.",he,"0: Bubbles, 1: the police, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" clearly refers to Bubbles. The sentence describes a series of actions performed by Bubbles: he turns himself in to the police, tries to hang himself, survives, and is taken to a detox facility.

1000,Policemen track the gangster down but the wife gives him a false alibi.,him,"0: Policemen, 1: the gangster, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""him"" most likely refers to ""the gangster"" for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""him"" is the object of the action ""gives a false alibi.""
2. It makes logical sense that the wife would give a false alibi to the gangster, not to the policemen.
3. ""Policemen"" is plural, while ""him"" is singular, so ""him"" cannot refer to ""Policemen.""
4. The gangster is the one being tracked down, so he would be the one needing an alibi.

Therefore, the pronoun ""him"" refers to ""the gangster,"" which is candidate 1.",1,1
1001,"Mrs. Bessie is an ardent Whig and a confidante of Mrs. Adams, but she nonetheless remains loyal to her Tory employers.",she,"0: Mrs. Bessie, 1: Mrs. Adams, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" refers to Mrs. Bessie. The sentence structure and context make it clear that Mrs. Bessie is the main subject of the sentence. The pronoun ""she"" is used to continue describing Mrs. Bessie's actions and loyalties. The sentence states that Mrs. Bessie is a Whig and a confidante of Mrs. Adams, but then uses ""she"" to indicate that despite these affiliations, Mrs. Bessie remains loyal to her Tory employers. This shows that ""she"" is referring back to Mrs. Bessie, not Mrs. Adams.",0,0

The context clearly indicates that it was Mika Hkkinen's engine that failed. The sentence states that ""Mika Hkkinen had been leading Villeneuve after the start but his engine failed,"" which directly links the engine failure to Mika Hkkinen. Therefore, the pronoun ""his"" is referring to Mika Hkkinen.",1,1
1003,"Hkkinen caught up with Jean Alesi quickly, but he was stuck behind him for several more laps.",him,"0: Hkkinen, 1: Jean Alesi, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""him"" clearly refers to Jean Alesi. The context indicates that Hkkinen caught up with Jean Alesi, but then was stuck behind ""him"" for several more laps. Since Hkkinen is the subject performing the action (catching up and being stuck), ""him"" must refer to the other person mentioned, which is Jean Alesi. It wouldn't make sense for Hkkinen to be stuck behind himself.",0,1
1004,Hkkinen tried to attack Senna but he ran into the back of him.,him,"0: Hkkinen, 1: Senna, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""him"" refers to. Let's break it down:

1. Hkkinen is trying to attack Senna.
2. ""He"" (likely referring to Hkkinen, as he's the subject of the action) ran into the back of ""him.""

Given the structure of the sentence, ""him"" most likely refers to Senna. This is because:

1. Hkkinen is the active party (trying to attack).
2. Senna is the one being acted upon (being attacked).
3. ""Him"" is used as the object of the preposition ""of"" in ""ran into the back of him.""

It wouldn't make sense for Hkkinen to run into the back of himself, so ""him"" must refer to Senna.",0,1

The sentence structure indicates that Mansell is the subject performing the action (attacking and getting ahead), while Senna is the object being acted upon. The pronoun ""him"" is used at the end of the sentence to avoid repeating Senna's name. Therefore, ""him"" refers to Senna, who is candidate 1.",0,1

The context clearly indicates that Arnoux was chasing Jones, and then Arnoux experienced fuel pressure problems. This is evident from the sequence of events described:

1. Arnoux was chasing Jones
2. ""he"" suffered fuel pressure problems
3. As a result, ""he"" dropped to sixth place
4. This led to ""handing second back to Villeneuve""

The pronoun ""he"" is used to avoid repeating Arnoux's name, and it's clear from the context that Arnoux is the subject experiencing these issues, not Jones.",1,0
1007,"Cleo asks Fin if Olivia is coming back, to which he replies that he doesn't know.",he,"0: Cleo, 1: Fin, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" is used to refer to the person who replies to Cleo's question.

1008,Robin has saved the life of Batman and he helped him on numerous occasions.,him,"0: Robin, 1: Batman, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who the pronoun ""him"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence mentions two characters: Robin and Batman.
2. The first part of the sentence states that ""Robin has saved the life of Batman.""
3. The second part uses ""he"" and ""him"" to describe further actions.

Given this structure, it's most logical that:
- ""he"" refers to Robin (the subject of the first clause)
- ""him"" refers to Batman (the object of the first clause)

This interpretation makes the most sense because it maintains a consistent subject (Robin) throughout the sentence, while ""him"" refers back to Batman, who was the recipient of Robin's actions in both parts of the sentence.

Therefore, the pronoun ""him"" most likely refers to Batman.",1,1
1009,Miguel stops Arnold from going alone with the promise that he can punish him afterwards.,him,"0: Miguel, 1: Arnold, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""him"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Miguel is the subject of the sentence, performing the action of stopping Arnold.
2. Arnold is the object of Miguel's action, being stopped from going alone.
3. The pronoun ""him"" appears in the phrase ""punish him afterwards.""

Given this context, it's more logical that Miguel would be promising to punish Arnold afterwards, rather than Arnold punishing Miguel or Miguel punishing himself. The act of punishment is likely a consequence or follow-up to stopping Arnold from going alone.

Therefore, ""him"" most likely refers to Arnold in this context.",0,1
1010,"Mori acknowledged the influence of Le Corbusier but believed he had surpassed the Swiss architect's urban designs, particularly in the Roppongi Hills project.",he,"0: Mori, 1: Le Corbusier, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Mori for the following reasons:

1. Mori is the subject of the sentence and the main person being discussed.
2. The sentence structure indicates that Mori is the one who ""believed he had surpassed"" Le Corbusier's designs.
3. The use of ""but"" after mentioning Le Corbusier's influence suggests a contrast, with Mori being the one who held this contrasting belief.
4. The mention of the Roppongi Hills project is likely referring to Mori's work, as it's presented as an example of surpassing Le Corbusier's designs.

Therefore, it is clear that ""he"" in this context refers to Mori, not Le Corbusier or any other person.",1,0
1011,"Godfrey Cass is now free to marry Frederick, but he continues to conceal the fact of his previous marriage and child from her.",his,"0: Frederick, 1: Godfrey Cass, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""his"" refers to Godfrey Cass. The sentence is discussing Godfrey Cass's actions and personal history. It mentions that Godfrey Cass is concealing information about ""his previous marriage and child"" from someone (presumably Frederick). The possessive pronoun ""his"" is clearly referring to Godfrey Cass's past, not Frederick's.",1,1
1012,Samuel found out about Mark when his brother came to Japan.,his,"0: Samuel, 1: Mark, 2: Neither","To determine who ""his"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and grammatical structure:

1. The sentence mentions two people: Samuel and Mark.
2. The pronoun ""his"" is used in the phrase ""his brother.""
3. The sentence structure suggests that Samuel is the main subject who found out about Mark.
4. The phrase ""when his brother came to Japan"" provides additional information about how Samuel found out about Mark.
5. It's more likely that the sentence is talking about Samuel's brother coming to Japan, rather than Mark's brother.

Given this analysis, it's most probable that ""his"" refers to Samuel. The sentence is describing Samuel's experience of finding out about Mark when Samuel's own brother came to Japan.",1,0
1013,"Sadly, Clara discovers Lily is one of the dead when her body washes up on deck.",her,"0: Lily, 1: Clara, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine whether the pronoun ""her"" refers to Clara or Lily. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence mentions two female characters: Clara and Lily.
2. The pronoun ""her"" is used in the phrase ""her body washes up on deck.""
3. The sentence states that Clara discovers Lily is one of the dead.
4. It's Lily's body that washes up on deck, not Clara's.

Given this information, it's clear that ""her"" refers to Lily, not Clara. Clara is the one making the discovery, while Lily is the one whose body is found. Therefore, the pronoun ""her"" in this context refers to Lily.",0,0
1014,"Kabanicha announces that Tichon must go, but not before instructing everyone on how to behave in his absence.",his,"0: Kabanicha, 1: Tichon, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""his"" clearly refers to Tichon. The context indicates that Tichon is the one who must go, and Kabanicha is giving instructions on how others should behave during Tichon's absence. The possessive pronoun ""his"" is used to indicate that it is Tichon's absence being referred to, not Kabanicha's.",1,1
1015,Busch died before Samuel arrived but his son-in-law Rudolf Serkin was still very active and the two men became staunch friends.,his,"0: Busch, 1: Samuel, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""his"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and grammatical structure of the sentence.

1. The pronoun ""his"" is used to indicate possession.
2. The sentence mentions ""his son-in-law Rudolf Serkin.""
3. The sentence structure suggests that ""his"" refers to someone who was already mentioned earlier in the sentence.
4. Busch is mentioned at the beginning of the sentence and is the subject of the first clause.
5. Samuel is introduced later in the sentence and is not directly connected to the phrase containing ""his.""

Given these observations, it is most logical that ""his"" refers to Busch. Busch is the primary subject of the sentence, and it makes sense that the text would be referring to Busch's son-in-law rather than Samuel's.",1,0
1016,"Max patiently watched over Charles when he was drunk, just as he had always watched over him.",he,"0: Max, 1: Charles, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence describes Max watching over Charles.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""when he was drunk"".
3. The sentence implies that Max has a history of watching over this person (""just as he had always watched over him"").

Given this information, it's more logical that ""he"" refers to Charles for the following reasons:
- It makes more sense that Max is watching over Charles when Charles is drunk, rather than Max watching over Charles while Max himself is drunk.
- The act of watching over someone who is drunk is a caretaking role, which aligns with Max's actions in the sentence.
- The phrase ""just as he had always watched over him"" further supports that Max (the subject) is watching over Charles (the object), implying that Charles is the one needing to be watched over, likely due to being drunk.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" in this context most likely refers to Charles.",1,"1

1017,"Prost retired whereas Robert rejoined after being push-started and pitted to replace his front wing, trailing Nannini in the race.",his,"0: Prost, 1: Robert, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""his"" refers to Robert. The context indicates that Robert rejoined the race after being push-started and then pitted to replace ""his front wing."" This action of replacing the front wing is directly associated with Robert, not Prost. Prost is mentioned as having retired, so he would not be involved in replacing a front wing or continuing in the race. Therefore, the pronoun ""his"" clearly refers to Robert.",0,1
1018,"Pathan women then squatted and urinated directly into the mouth of the slaves until they drowned in the urine, taking turns one at a time.",they,"0: Pathan women, 1: the slaves, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" refers to ""the slaves"" for the following reasons:

1. Context: The sentence describes an action being done to the slaves by the Pathan women.
2. Grammatical structure: The pronoun ""they"" is used in the clause ""until they drowned in the urine,"" which indicates that ""they"" are the recipients of the action.
3. Logical flow: It makes more sense that the slaves would be the ones drowning in urine, as they are described as the victims in this scenario.
4. Subject-object relationship: The Pathan women are the active subjects performing the action, while the slaves are the passive objects receiving the action.

Therefore, ""they"" most likely refers to ""the slaves"" in this context.",1,1
1019,"Once alone, Boris attempts to seduce Arny, although he resists his advances.",he,"0: Arny, 1: Boris, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""he"" refers to: Arny or Boris. The key to understanding this is in the phrase ""he resists his advances."" 

The sentence structure indicates that Boris is the one attempting to seduce Arny. Therefore, Arny would be the one resisting the advances. The pronoun ""he"" in this context refers to Arny, as he is the one performing the action of resisting.",0,0
1020,Henry advises Max to find out if Jack is married before he gets involved with him.,he,"0: Henry, 1: Max, 2: Neither","To determine who ""he"" refers to in this sentence, we need to consider the context and logical flow of the statement.

1. Henry is advising Max about Jack.
2. The advice is to find out if Jack is married.
3. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the phrase ""before he gets involved with him.""

Given this context, it's most logical that ""he"" refers to Max. The sentence is about Max potentially getting involved with Jack, and Henry is advising Max to check Jack's marital status first. It wouldn't make sense for Henry to be getting involved with Jack in this context, as Henry is the one giving advice.

Therefore, ""he"" most likely refers to Max (candidate 1).",1,1
1021,"Ian is obsessed with John, but his erratic behavior disturbs him.",his,"0: Ian, 1: John, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""his"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Ian is obsessed with John,"" establishing Ian as the subject and John as the object.
2. The second part of the sentence, ""but his erratic behavior disturbs him,"" introduces the pronoun ""his"" and describes erratic behavior.
3. The use of ""but"" suggests a contrast or unexpected element, which implies that the erratic behavior is more likely associated with Ian, the subject of the first clause.
4. It would be more logical for Ian's behavior to disturb John, rather than John's behavior disturbing Ian, given the context of Ian's obsession.

Based on these points, it is more likely that ""his"" refers to Ian (candidate 0). The erratic behavior is probably Ian's, which disturbs John as a result of Ian's obsession.",0,0
1022,"Robert threatens Frank until, panicked, he turns over Evies phone number.",he,"0: Robert, 1: Frank, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Frank. The context suggests that Robert is threatening Frank, which causes Frank to become panicked and turn over Evie's phone number. The phrase ""panicked, he turns over"" indicates that the person who is panicked is the one turning over the phone number, which would be Frank in this situation. Robert, being the one doing the threatening, is unlikely to be the one panicking and giving up information.",1,1
1023,"David truly loved and trusted Wolfgang now, where before he had been hostile and spiteful toward him.",he,"0: David, 1: Wolfgang, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence is about David's feelings towards Wolfgang.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""where before he had been hostile and spiteful toward him.""
3. The subject of the main clause is David, who is described as loving and trusting Wolfgang.
4. The pronoun ""he"" is contrasting a past state with the current state described in the main clause.
5. The phrase ""toward him"" at the end clearly refers to Wolfgang, as David's feelings are directed at Wolfgang.

Given this analysis, it's clear that ""he"" refers to David, as it's describing David's past feelings towards Wolfgang (hostile and spiteful) in contrast to his current feelings (love and trust).",0,0
1024,Marinovich was born Marvin Scott but his mother later changed his name to Todd Marvin.,his,"0: Marinovich, 1: Marvin Scott, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which candidate the pronoun ""his"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Marinovich was born Marvin Scott,"" indicating that Marinovich and Marvin Scott are the same person.
2. The pronoun ""his"" is used in the phrase ""his mother later changed his name,"" which refers to the person whose name was changed.
3. Since Marinovich and Marvin Scott are the same person, and the name change applies to this person, the pronoun ""his"" refers to both Marinovich and Marvin Scott.

Given that the candidates are presented as separate options (0: Marinovich, 1: Marvin Scott), and we know they are the same person, we cannot choose between them. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is 2: Neither, as the pronoun actually refers to both candidates simultaneously.",1,2
1025,Cardinals manager Tony LaRussa admired McEwing so much that he requested a pair of the player's spikes upon the trade.,he,"0: McEwing, 1: Cardinals manager Tony LaRussa, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Cardinals manager Tony LaRussa. The sentence structure indicates that LaRussa is the subject performing the action of admiring McEwing and requesting his spikes. The pronoun ""he"" is used to avoid repeating LaRussa's name in the same sentence. It's clear that LaRussa is the one making the request, not McEwing or anyone else.",0,1
1026,Journalist Jack Anderson speculated that Watergate Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox had been fired because he had started to investigate Rebozo's role in Nixon accepting covert payments.,he,"0: Journalist Jack Anderson, 1: Watergate Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions two individuals: Journalist Jack Anderson and Watergate Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox.

2. The pronoun ""he"" appears in the clause ""he had started to investigate Rebozo's role,"" which is describing an action.

3. Given the context, it's more logical that the Special Prosecutor (Archibald Cox) would be investigating Rebozo's role in Nixon accepting covert payments, rather than the journalist Jack Anderson.

4. The sentence structure also suggests that ""he"" refers to Archibald Cox, as it's discussing the reason for Cox's firing.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Watergate Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox.",0,1
1027,"While Rachel has always been attracted to the vivacious Tina because she is so beautiful, she is completely unaware of the quiet Pooja's love for him.",she,"0: Rachel, 1: the vivacious Tina, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. The pronoun ""she"" appears twice in the sentence.
2. The first ""she"" is clearly referring to Tina, as it states ""she is so beautiful"" right after mentioning Tina.
3. The second ""she"" is referring to Rachel, as it's talking about someone being unaware of Pooja's love, which logically would be Rachel.
4. The question asks specifically about which candidate the pronoun refers to, without specifying which instance of ""she"" we should consider.
5. Given that ""she"" refers to both Rachel and Tina in different parts of the sentence, we can't definitively choose between them as the single referent for ""she"".

Therefore, since the pronoun ""she"" refers to both Rachel and Tina at different points in the sentence, and we can't determine a single correct answer between the two, the most appropriate response is ""Neither"".",1,2
1028,"Hanna asks Ellen if this is true, and she says no.",she,"0: Hanna, 1: Ellen, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""she says no."" Given the context, it's more likely that Ellen is the one responding to Hanna's question. The sentence structure suggests that Hanna is asking Ellen something, and then Ellen is the one providing the response. Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Ellen.",1,1
1029,"Vanessa still has Ludmilla, so Smith comes back for her.",her,"0: Ludmilla, 1: Vanessa, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""her"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence mentions two female characters: Vanessa and Ludmilla.
2. The pronoun ""her"" is used at the end of the sentence in the phrase ""comes back for her.""
3. The sentence structure suggests that Smith is coming back for someone.
4. Logically, Smith would be coming back for Vanessa, not Ludmilla, because:
   a) Vanessa is mentioned as still having Ludmilla, implying Vanessa is the main subject.
   b) It wouldn't make sense for Smith to come back for Ludmilla if Vanessa still has her.

Therefore, the pronoun ""her"" most likely refers to Vanessa.",0,1
1030,"Layla is in love with Anya, but Harry knows that she is only pretending to reciprocate.",she,"0: Layla, 1: Anya, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence mentions three people: Layla, Anya, and Harry.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""she is only pretending to reciprocate.""
3. The sentence structure suggests that ""she"" refers to Anya because:
   a. Layla is described as being in love with Anya.
   b. The sentence implies that someone is pretending to reciprocate Layla's feelings.
   c. It wouldn't make sense for Layla to pretend to reciprocate her own feelings.
4. Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Anya, who is pretending to reciprocate Layla's love.

Based on this analysis, the pronoun ""she"" refers to Anya.",1,1
1031,"Melissa is attacked by Wendy, until she recognizes her as a high school classmate.",she,"0: Melissa, 1: Wendy, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Melissa is being attacked by Wendy.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""until she recognizes her as a high school classmate.""

The most logical interpretation is that ""she"" refers to Melissa because:
a) Melissa is the subject of the main clause and the first person mentioned.
b) It makes more sense that the person being attacked (Melissa) would recognize the attacker (Wendy) as a classmate, rather than the other way around.
c) If ""she"" referred to Wendy, the sentence would imply that Wendy was attacking Melissa without recognizing her, which is less likely.

Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Melissa.",1,0
1032,"Yoshi could not save Tang Shen from being murdered, but he did save his sons.",his,"0: Yoshi, 1: Tang Shen, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""his"" refers to Yoshi for the following reasons:

1. Yoshi is the main subject of the sentence and the one performing the actions (could not save, did save).
2. The pronoun ""his"" is used in relation to ""sons,"" implying ownership or relation.
3. It's more logical for ""his sons"" to refer to Yoshi's sons rather than Tang Shen's sons, as Tang Shen is mentioned as the object of the first clause and is female (typically referred to as ""her"" rather than ""his"").
4. The structure of the sentence suggests that Yoshi is the consistent subject throughout, first unable to save Tang Shen, but then able to save his own sons.

Therefore, the pronoun ""his"" most likely refers to Yoshi.",1,0
1033,"The heroes show up and try to kill the Aliens, but they can not and are laughed at.",they,"0: The heroes, 1: the Aliens, 2: Neither","In this sentence, ""they"" most likely refers to ""The heroes"" for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""they"" is the subject of the second part of the sentence, which is a continuation of the actions of ""The heroes"" from the first part.

2. ""The heroes"" is the main subject of the sentence, introduced at the beginning, making it the most likely antecedent for the pronoun ""they.""

3. The actions described (""can not"" and ""are laughed at"") are more logically associated with the heroes' failed attempt to kill the Aliens, rather than the Aliens themselves.

4. It would be grammatically and logically inconsistent for ""they"" to refer to ""the Aliens"" in this context, as the Aliens are the object of the heroes' action, not the subject of the latter part of the sentence.

Therefore, ""they"" most likely refers to ""The heroes"" (candidate 0).",0,0
1034,"Terry followed Hoke cautiously, worried about being surprised by an ambush or by a flank attack from his right.",his,"0: Terry, 1: Hoke, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""his"" refers to Terry. The reasoning is as follows:

1. The sentence structure indicates that Terry is the subject and the one performing the action of following Hoke.
2. The pronoun ""his"" is used in the phrase ""from his right,"" which describes Terry's perspective or position.
3. It makes more logical sense for Terry to be worried about an attack from his own right flank, rather than Hoke's right flank, since Terry is the one following and potentially vulnerable to an ambush.

Therefore, the pronoun ""his"" most likely refers to Terry, who is the first candidate (index 0) in the given options.",0,0
1035,"Rathmullan was initially granted to Sir Ralph Bingley but he was soon passed to his son-in-law, Bishop Knox.",his,"0: Rathmullan, 1: Sir Ralph Bingley, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""his"" refers to Sir Ralph Bingley. The context indicates that Rathmullan was initially granted to Sir Ralph Bingley, but then ""he"" (referring to Sir Ralph Bingley) was passed to his son-in-law. The use of ""his"" in this context is referring to Sir Ralph Bingley's son-in-law, implying that Sir Ralph Bingley is the antecedent of the pronoun ""his"".

Rathmullan is a place and cannot possess a son-in-law, so it cannot be the referent of ""his"". Therefore, the pronoun ""his"" clearly refers to Sir Ralph Bingley.",0,1
1036,"Libby is questioned about Daisy, but she avoids talking about her and attacks Karl about his past infidelity.",she,"0: Libby, 1: Daisy, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Libby. The sentence structure suggests that Libby is the main subject and the one performing the actions. The sentence states that ""Libby is questioned about Daisy, but she avoids talking about her and attacks Karl..."" The pronoun ""she"" is used to continue describing Libby's actions (avoiding talking and attacking Karl), rather than referring to Daisy. Daisy is mentioned as the topic of questioning, but not as the one performing any actions in this sentence.",0,0
1037,"Delilah tries to reconcile with Lizzy, but she insists that their relationship is over.",she,"0: Delilah, 1: Lizzy, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" refers to Lizzy. We can determine this because:

1. The sentence structure indicates that Delilah is the subject performing the action of trying to reconcile.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the second part of the sentence, referring to the person who is insisting that the relationship is over.
3. Logically, it makes more sense that Lizzy would be the one insisting the relationship is over, since Delilah is trying to reconcile.

Therefore, ""she"" in this context refers to Lizzy, not Delilah.",1,1
1038,"Dirk applies for the Legion as Sun, but is rejected as he has only demonstrated his ability to generate light.",he,"0: Dirk, 1: Sun, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" clearly refers to Dirk. The sentence structure indicates that Dirk is the main subject who applies for the Legion and is rejected. The pronoun ""he"" is used to continue referring to Dirk in the latter part of the sentence, explaining why he was rejected. The phrase ""as he has only demonstrated his ability to generate light"" provides additional information about Dirk, not about Sun. Therefore, ""he"" unambiguously refers to Dirk.",0,0
1039,Chris then breaks up with Anthony again after he realizes that he is not who he wants.,he,"0: Chris, 1: Anthony, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""he"" the pronoun refers to. There are three instances of ""he"" in the sentence:

1. ""he realizes""
2. ""he is not""
3. ""he wants""

Let's analyze each:

1. ""he realizes"" - This likely refers to Chris, as Chris is the subject of the sentence and the one performing the action of breaking up.
2. ""he is not"" - This appears to refer to Anthony, as Chris is realizing something about Anthony (that Anthony is not who Chris wants).
3. ""he wants"" - This refers back to Chris, as it's describing Chris's desires.

Given this analysis, we can conclude that the pronoun ""he"" in this sentence refers to Chris in two instances and Anthony in one instance. Since the question doesn't specify which ""he"" we're focusing on, and the pronoun refers to both candidates at different points, we cannot definitively choose between Chris and Anthony.",1,2
1040,"Natalia has feelings for Marissa, but she's never really had the opportunity to talk about a relationship with her.",she,"0: Natalia, 1: Marissa, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Natalia for the following reasons:

1. Natalia is the subject of the main clause and is mentioned first, making her the more prominent character in the sentence.
2. The sentence is describing Natalia's feelings and actions, so it's more natural for the pronoun to continue referring to her.
3. The phrase ""but she's never really had the opportunity"" implies that this is a continuation of Natalia's perspective and experience.
4. The use of ""her"" at the end of the sentence likely refers to Marissa, further suggesting that ""she"" earlier in the sentence refers to Natalia to maintain a clear distinction between the two people.

While it's not impossible for ""she"" to refer to Marissa, the structure and context of the sentence make it much more likely that ""she"" refers to Natalia.",0,0
1041,"Ivaylo tried to ally with Nogai, but he had him murdered, and made the new Bulgarian Emperor George Terter his vassal.",him,"0: Ivaylo, 1: Nogai, 2: Neither","In the given sentence, the pronoun 'him' refers to Ivaylo. The sentence structure indicates that Nogai is the subject who performed the action of murdering, and 'him' is the object of that action. Since Ivaylo is mentioned first and is trying to ally with Nogai, it makes sense that Nogai would have Ivaylo murdered, not the other way around. Therefore, 'him' refers to Ivaylo.",0,0
1042,"Dunning goes as far as to say that raising awareness of Kony was not even useful, as law enforcement groups had been after him for years.",him,"0: Dunning, 1: Kony, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""him"" clearly refers to Kony, not Dunning. The context indicates that law enforcement groups had been pursuing someone for years, and this person is the subject of the awareness-raising efforts mentioned. Dunning is presented as the one making a statement about Kony, so ""him"" must refer to Kony, who is the subject of Dunning's comment and the target of law enforcement efforts.",0,1
1043,Angered Manfred then decides to kill Ivan but accidentally kills his own daughter.,his,"0: Ivan, 1: Angered Manfred, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""his"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence mentions two male characters: Manfred and Ivan.
2. The pronoun ""his"" is used in the phrase ""his own daughter.""
3. The word ""own"" is a key indicator here, as it implies possession or a close relationship.
4. It's more likely that ""his own daughter"" refers to Manfred's daughter rather than Ivan's daughter.
5. The sentence structure suggests that Manfred is the main subject performing the actions (deciding to kill Ivan and accidentally killing).

Given these points, it's most logical to conclude that ""his"" refers to Manfred, as he is the one who accidentally kills his own daughter.",1,1
1044,"Katy also finds Ellen appalling, but she is delighted and decides to marry her.",her,"0: Ellen, 1: Katy, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""her"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence mentions two people: Katy and Ellen.
2. The pronoun ""her"" is used at the end of the sentence in the phrase ""marry her.""
3. The subject of the second part of the sentence is ""she,"" which refers to Katy (as Katy is the one who finds Ellen appalling but is delighted).
4. It wouldn't make sense for Katy to marry herself, so ""her"" must refer to Ellen.

Therefore, the pronoun ""her"" refers to Ellen.",0,0
1045,"Wade comes to see Daniel, but the most he gets out of him is a smile.",he,"0: Wade, 1: Daniel, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which person the pronoun ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Wade is the subject of the first clause: ""Wade comes to see Daniel""
2. The second clause starts with ""but"", indicating a contrast or unexpected result
3. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the phrase ""the most he gets out of him""
4. ""him"" in this phrase clearly refers to Daniel, as Wade is getting something (a smile) out of Daniel

Given this analysis, ""he"" in the phrase ""the most he gets"" must refer to Wade. Wade is the one who is trying to get something (more than just a smile) out of Daniel. It wouldn't make sense for Daniel to be getting something out of himself.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Wade.",0,0
1046,"Though Gino tries to avoid Ross, he can not help but eventually fall in love with him.",he,"0: Gino, 1: Ross, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which person ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the structure:

1. The sentence starts with ""Though Gino tries to avoid Ross""
2. Then it continues with ""he can not help but eventually fall in love with him""

The pronoun ""he"" is the subject of the second part of the sentence. It's more likely that this pronoun refers to Gino for the following reasons:

1. Gino is the subject of the first part of the sentence, making him the more prominent character.
2. The sentence structure suggests a contrast between Gino's initial actions (trying to avoid Ross) and his eventual feelings (falling in love).
3. If ""he"" referred to Ross, the sentence would be somewhat confusing and less coherent.

Therefore, it's most logical that ""he"" refers to Gino in this context.",0,0
1047,"Yuri is initially cold towards Tate, but he eventually warms up to him.",him,"0: Yuri, 1: Tate, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""him"" refers to Tate. We can determine this because:

1. The sentence structure indicates that Yuri is the subject who is performing the action (warming up).
2. The pronoun ""him"" is used as the object of the preposition ""to"" at the end of the sentence.
3. Since Yuri is already mentioned by name, it wouldn't make sense for ""him"" to refer back to Yuri.
4. Tate is the only other person mentioned in the sentence, and it logically follows that Yuri would be warming up to Tate.

Therefore, the pronoun ""him"" refers to Tate, which is candidate 1.",0,1
1048,Leopold then appealed to King Edward II to call off or control his self-interested agent.,his,"0: Leopold, 1: King Edward II, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""his"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence starts with ""Leopold,"" indicating he is the main subject.
2. Leopold is appealing to King Edward II, which means King Edward II is a secondary subject.
3. The pronoun ""his"" is used in the phrase ""his self-interested agent.""
4. It's more likely that the ""self-interested agent"" belongs to King Edward II rather than Leopold because:
   a) Leopold is the one appealing to King Edward II about the agent.
   b) It wouldn't make sense for Leopold to appeal to the king about his own agent.

Therefore, the pronoun ""his"" most likely refers to King Edward II.",0,1
1049,"Because Lorelai became pregnant with Rebecca when she was only sixteen, the two are more like friends than mother and daughter.",she,"0: Lorelai, 1: Rebecca, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" refers to Lorelai. The context indicates that Lorelai became pregnant at a young age, which is the main subject of the sentence. The pronoun ""she"" is used in relation to the age at which Lorelai became pregnant, not in reference to Rebecca. Therefore, ""she"" clearly refers to Lorelai in this context.",0,0
1050,Peter had not realised how old Henry was until he sees his daughter.,he,"0: Peter, 1: Henry, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine whether the pronoun ""he"" refers to Peter or Henry. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Peter had not realised...""
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""until he sees his daughter.""
3. The action of seeing a daughter is more likely to be associated with Henry, as the sentence is about Peter realizing Henry's age.
4. It would be unusual for Peter to realize Henry's age by seeing his own (Peter's) daughter.

Given this analysis, it's more logical that ""he"" refers to Peter, who is realizing Henry's age upon seeing Henry's daughter. The pronoun ""he"" is the subject of the verb ""sees,"" and it makes more sense for Peter to be the one doing the realizing and seeing in this context.",0,0
1051,"Kat is furious and decides not to get together with Allie, so as not to break her sister's heart.",her,"0: Kat, 1: Allie, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""her"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence mentions two people: Kat and Allie.
2. Kat is the subject of the sentence and the main actor.
3. The pronoun ""her"" is used in the phrase ""her sister's heart.""
4. Given that Kat is deciding not to get together with Allie to avoid breaking someone's heart, it's logical to assume that Allie is Kat's sister.
5. Therefore, ""her sister"" refers to Kat's sister, which is Allie.

Based on this analysis, we can conclude that ""her"" refers to Kat, as it's Kat's sister (Allie) whose heart she doesn't want to break.",0,0
1052,"Although Chris tells Michael to leave, he stays because he has friends locally.",he,"0: Chris, 1: Michael, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. ""Although Chris tells Michael to leave"" - This sets up the initial action, where Chris is telling Michael to leave.

2. ""he stays"" - This is the first use of the pronoun ""he"". We need to determine who this refers to.

3. ""because he has friends locally"" - This is the second use of ""he"", which is likely referring to the same person as the first ""he"".

The key to solving this is understanding who is more likely to stay because they have friends locally. Since Chris is telling Michael to leave, it's more logical that Michael is the one who decides to stay despite being told to leave. If Chris had friends locally, there would be no reason for him to tell Michael to leave.

Therefore, both instances of ""he"" in this sentence most likely refer to Michael.",1,1
1053,"Tirpitz was recalled by Wilhelm II, and after he returned to Berlin he lost interest in East Asia: he was now developing a battle fleet.",he,"0: Tirpitz, 1: Wilhelm II, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which person the pronoun ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Tirpitz was recalled by Wilhelm II.""
2. Then it continues with ""and after he returned to Berlin...""
3. The sentence concludes with ""he was now developing a battle fleet.""

The pronoun ""he"" is used twice in this sentence. In both cases, it's more likely to refer to Tirpitz rather than Wilhelm II for the following reasons:

1. Tirpitz is the subject of the first clause and the main focus of the sentence.
2. The action of returning to Berlin logically follows being recalled, which happened to Tirpitz.
3. The development of a battle fleet is more likely to be an action associated with Tirpitz, who was a naval officer, rather than Wilhelm II, who was the Emperor.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Tirpitz.",0,0
1054,"Later, Kirsten ostracizes Julie after suspicions about the business and she fires her after she uncovers that it has become a prostitution ring.",her,"0: Julie, 1: Kirsten, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""her"" the pronoun refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Kirsten ostracizes Julie.""
2. Then it mentions ""she fires her.""

The pronoun ""she"" in ""she fires her"" likely refers to Kirsten, as Kirsten is the subject performing the action of ostracizing and then firing. This means that ""her"" in ""she fires her"" must refer to Julie, who is being fired.

The pronoun ""her"" is used in the object position, indicating that it's the person receiving the action (being fired). Since Julie is the one being ostracized and then fired by Kirsten, it makes the most sense for ""her"" to refer to Julie.",1,0
1055,McMurray congratulated Menard publicly after the race when he was interviewed about his finish.,he,"0: McMurray, 1: Menard, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions two people: McMurray and Menard.
2. The pronoun ""he"" appears in the clause ""when he was interviewed about his finish.""
3. The main action of the sentence is that McMurray congratulated Menard.
4. It's more likely that McMurray would be interviewed about his finish after the race, as he is the subject of the main clause and the one doing the congratulating.
5. If Menard was being interviewed, the sentence would likely be structured differently to make that clear.

Based on this analysis, it's most probable that ""he"" refers to McMurray, as he is the main subject of the sentence and the one more likely to be interviewed about his finish after congratulating another racer.",1,0
1056,"When Princess Anne married Duchess Tanya after having divorced Mark Phillips, she chose to do so in the Church of Scotland.",she,"0: Princess Anne, 1: Duchess Tanya, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Princess Anne for the following reasons:

1. Princess Anne is the main subject of the sentence and is mentioned first.
2. The action of choosing to marry in the Church of Scotland is more likely to be a decision made by Princess Anne, as she is the one getting married.
3. The phrase ""after having divorced Mark Phillips"" provides additional context about Princess Anne's past, making her the more prominent figure in the sentence.
4. It's more common for the person of royal status (Princess Anne) to be the one making decisions about their wedding location, especially when it involves a significant choice like the Church of Scotland.

While Duchess Tanya is mentioned in the sentence, she is not the primary subject and is less likely to be the one referred to by ""she"" in this context.",0,0
1057,"Wanda asks Regina if she wants to go with him, but Regina does not want to leave Owuor.",she,"0: Wanda, 1: Regina, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" clearly refers to Regina. We can determine this because:

1. The sentence structure indicates that Wanda is asking Regina a question.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the context of someone being asked if they want to go somewhere.
3. The latter part of the sentence mentions that ""Regina does not want to leave Owuor,"" which directly corresponds to the earlier part where ""she"" is asked about going somewhere.

Therefore, ""she"" in this context is referring to Regina, not Wanda.",1,1
1058,Damian attempts to seduce Bob but he rejects and ridicules him.,he,"0: Damian, 1: Bob, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Damian is trying to seduce Bob.
2. ""he"" rejects and ridicules someone.

Given this information, it's more likely that ""he"" refers to Bob because:
- Bob is the object of Damian's seduction attempt.
- The action of rejecting and ridiculing aligns with Bob's response to Damian's seduction.
- It wouldn't make sense for Damian to reject and ridicule himself in this context.

Therefore, ""he"" most likely refers to Bob.",1,1
1059,Joyce then tries to attack Harriet and so she stabs her to death too.,she,"0: Joyce, 1: Harriet, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Joyce is the subject of the first part of the sentence: ""Joyce then tries to attack Harriet""
2. The pronoun ""she"" appears in the second part of the sentence: ""and so she stabs her to death too""
3. The action of stabbing is a continuation of Joyce's aggressive behavior (trying to attack)
4. ""Her"" in this context likely refers to Harriet, as she is the object of Joyce's attack

Given this analysis, it's most logical that ""she"" refers to Joyce, as Joyce is the one initiating the aggressive action and continuing it by stabbing.",1,0
1060,"Duncan broke up with Victor because of this, but did not explain his reasons for doing so.",his,"0: Duncan, 1: Victor, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""his"" most likely refers to Duncan for the following reasons:

1. Duncan is the subject of the sentence and the main actor performing the actions (breaking up and not explaining).
2. The pronoun ""his"" is used in the context of ""his reasons for doing so,"" which directly relates to the action of breaking up that Duncan initiated.
3. It's more natural and logical for Duncan to have reasons for breaking up with Victor, rather than Victor having reasons for Duncan breaking up with him.
4. The sentence structure suggests that ""his reasons"" are connected to the subject (Duncan) who performed the action of breaking up and not explaining.

Therefore, the pronoun ""his"" most likely refers to Duncan.",0,0
1061,"Erika stays, knowing that not only will Gwyneth be angry, but she will not let him visit Dexter in the hospital.",she,"0: Gwyneth, 1: Erika, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Erika is the subject of the first part of the sentence, and she is staying.
2. Gwyneth is mentioned as someone who will be angry.
3. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the context of not letting ""him"" visit Dexter in the hospital.

Given this information, it's more likely that ""she"" refers to Gwyneth rather than Erika. The sentence structure suggests that Gwyneth is the one who will be angry and who will not allow someone (referred to as ""him"") to visit Dexter. Erika is already established as the subject of the first part of the sentence, so it would be unusual for the pronoun ""she"" to refer back to Erika in this context.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Gwyneth.",1,0
1062,"Dante eventually proposed to Frank, although he was still in love with Bridget.",he,"0: Dante, 1: Frank, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence mentions two male characters: Dante and Frank.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""although he was still in love with Bridget.""
3. This clause provides additional information about one of the characters.
4. The main action of the sentence is ""Dante eventually proposed to Frank.""
5. The ""although"" clause suggests a contrast or contradiction to the main action.

Given this analysis, it makes more sense for ""he"" to refer to Dante rather than Frank. The sentence implies that despite Dante's feelings for Bridget, he still proposed to Frank. It would be less logical for Frank to be in love with Bridget in this context, as he is the one being proposed to.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Dante.",0,0
1063,"Steven is bummed out, but Gabriel is so upset that he decides to leave Cancn and return to England.",he,"0: Steven, 1: Gabriel, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Gabriel for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure indicates two separate actions or states for Steven and Gabriel.
2. Steven is described as ""bummed out,"" which is a less intense emotional state.
3. Gabriel is described as ""so upset,"" which is a more intense emotional state.
4. The pronoun ""he"" is used in conjunction with the action of deciding to leave Cancun and return to England.
5. This action of leaving is more likely to be associated with the person who is ""so upset"" (Gabriel) rather than the person who is just ""bummed out"" (Steven).

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most logically refers to Gabriel.",1,1
1064,Yuri tells Charlie but he does not believe him until he catches Nick with some of the money Ronnie used to bribe him.,he,"0: Yuri, 1: Charlie, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""he"" the pronoun refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Yuri tells Charlie something.
2. ""He"" does not believe ""him"".
3. ""He"" catches Nick with some money.

The pronoun ""he"" is more likely to refer to Charlie because:
1. Charlie is the recipient of the information from Yuri, so he would be the one to believe or not believe.
2. It makes more sense for Charlie to be the one catching Nick, as Yuri is already aware of the situation (he's the one telling Charlie).
3. The structure of the sentence suggests that ""he"" (Charlie) doesn't believe ""him"" (Yuri) until he (Charlie) catches Nick.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Charlie.",1,1
1065,"Later, Felicia appeals to Helen, but she refuses.",she,"0: Helen, 1: Felicia, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions two people: Felicia and Helen.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""but she refuses.""
3. The sentence structure suggests that ""she"" refers to the person being appealed to, not the one doing the appealing.
4. Felicia is the one appealing to Helen.
5. Helen is the one being appealed to.
6. Therefore, ""she"" in ""she refuses"" most likely refers to Helen, as Helen is the one in the position to refuse the appeal.

Based on this analysis, the pronoun ""she"" refers to Helen.",0,0

1. The sentence structure suggests that 'they' is the subject of the second part of the sentence, contrasting with the courtiers' demand.
2. The pronoun 'they' is used in relation to being 'granted relative clemency,' which logically follows the courtiers' demand for their execution.
3. The phrase 'had the rebellious governor imprisoned' further supports that 'they' refers to the Arabs, as it implies that the Arabs were not executed but instead treated with clemency.",0,0
1067,"Eliza tries to find Barbara, but she is hidden by a sympathetic harem girl.",she,"0: Barbara, 1: Eliza, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" refers to Barbara, not Eliza.

1068,Tchaikovsky replied defensively to Taneyev but he was appreciative of his candor.,his,"0: Tchaikovsky, 1: Taneyev, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""his"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions two people: Tchaikovsky and Taneyev.
2. The pronoun ""his"" is used in the phrase ""his candor.""
3. ""Candor"" means honesty or frankness in speech.
4. The sentence states that Tchaikovsky was ""appreciative of his candor.""

Given this information, it's more logical that Tchaikovsky would be appreciative of Taneyev's candor, rather than his own. It wouldn't make sense for Tchaikovsky to be appreciative of his own candor in this context.

Therefore, ""his"" most likely refers to Taneyev.",1,1
1069,"Abel advises Juan to get married, but he acknowledges the women he is attracted to tend to be already married.",he,"0: Abel, 1: Juan, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence starts with ""Abel advises Juan to get married"".
2. Then it continues with ""but he acknowledges...""

The pronoun ""he"" is more likely to refer to Abel for the following reasons:
- Abel is the subject of the main clause and is performing the action of advising.
- The ""but"" conjunction introduces a contrasting idea, which is more likely to be related to the person giving the advice (Abel) rather than the person receiving it (Juan).
- The acknowledgment about being attracted to married women seems to be a personal observation that explains why Abel is advising Juan to get married, despite his own experiences.

Therefore, based on the context and structure of the sentence, ""he"" most likely refers to Abel.",1,0
1070,"Michelle then turns to Susan and promises that, if she hires her, she'll make her a star with one mention in JJ.",she,"0: Susan, 1: Michelle, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""she"" refers to Michelle or Susan. Let's break it down:

1. Michelle turns to Susan
2. Michelle promises something
3. The promise is about hiring and making someone a star

The key here is that Michelle is the one making the promise, so she would be the one doing the hiring. Therefore, the first ""she"" in ""if she hires her"" refers to Michelle.

The second ""she"" in ""she'll make her a star"" also refers to Michelle, as she's the one making the promise and would be the one to make Susan a star.

The pronoun ""her"" in both instances refers to Susan, as she would be the one being hired and made into a star.

Given this analysis, the pronoun ""she"" in question refers to Michelle.",1,1
1071,The doctors tell the monks to flee so that they can defeat the Intelligence.,they,"0: The doctors, 1: the monks, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence has two groups: ""the doctors"" and ""the monks"".
2. The pronoun ""they"" appears in the clause ""so that they can defeat the Intelligence"".
3. The action of ""defeating the Intelligence"" is more likely to be associated with the doctors rather than the monks.
4. The doctors are telling the monks to flee, which implies that the doctors are staying to handle the situation.
5. Monks are generally associated with peaceful activities, not defeating an entity called ""the Intelligence"".

Based on this analysis, it's more logical and contextually appropriate for ""they"" to refer to ""the doctors"".",0,0
1072,"The elder Mackenzie used to beat Golly, especially after he had been drinking.",he,"0: The elder Mackenzie, 1: Golly, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to ""The elder Mackenzie"" for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""The elder Mackenzie"" is the main subject and the one performing the action (beating Golly).

2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""after he had been drinking,"" which implies that the person doing the drinking is the same person doing the beating.

3. It's more logical and contextually appropriate that ""The elder Mackenzie"" would be the one drinking and then becoming violent, rather than Golly drinking and then being beaten.

4. The phrase ""especially after he had been drinking"" is providing additional information about the circumstances under which the elder Mackenzie would beat Golly, further supporting that ""he"" refers to the elder Mackenzie.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to ""The elder Mackenzie"" (candidate 0).",0,0
1073,"James occasionally visits Archie, but he starts to take a fancy to local school headteacher Katrina Finlay.",he,"0: James, 1: Archie, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to James for the following reasons:

1. James is the subject of the first clause and is mentioned first in the sentence, making him the most prominent character.
2. The sentence structure suggests that the same person who ""occasionally visits Archie"" is also the one who ""starts to take a fancy to local school headteacher Katrina Finlay.""
3. It would be grammatically and logically inconsistent for ""he"" to refer to Archie, as Archie is the object of the first clause and not the one performing the actions described.
4. The use of ""but"" indicates a contrast or change in the subject's (James') behavior, further supporting that ""he"" refers to James.

1074,Roman citizens cheered on the flight of the soldiers but they would not assist them.,them,"0: the soldiers, 1: Roman citizens, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""them"" refers to, let's analyze the sentence:

""Roman citizens cheered on the flight of the soldiers but they would not assist them.""

In this sentence, ""them"" is used at the end and refers to a group that is not being assisted. The structure of the sentence indicates that:

1. Roman citizens are the subject of the main clause.
2. The soldiers are mentioned as the object of ""the flight of"".
3. ""They"" (referring to Roman citizens) would not assist ""them"".

Given this structure, ""them"" must refer to a group other than the Roman citizens (since ""they"" already refers to the citizens). The only other group mentioned in the sentence is ""the soldiers"".

Therefore, ""them"" refers to ""the soldiers"".",0,0
1075,The Xhosa warriors were reluctant to attack the families and so they allowed them to pass and resupply the troops.,them,"0: the families, 1: The Xhosa warriors, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""them"" refers to ""the families"" for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure indicates that the Xhosa warriors are the subject performing the action (allowing), while ""them"" is the object of that action.

2. The context suggests that the Xhosa warriors are showing leniency towards another group, which is logically ""the families.""

3. It wouldn't make sense for the Xhosa warriors to allow themselves to pass and resupply the troops, so ""them"" cannot refer to the warriors.

4. The phrase ""to pass and resupply the troops"" further confirms that ""them"" refers to ""the families,"" as families would be the ones needing to pass through and potentially resupply troops.

Therefore, the pronoun ""them"" clearly refers to ""the families"" (candidate 0) in this context.",0,0

The sentence structure indicates that Ozzy is the subject who made the decision to part ways with Zakk Wylde. The reasoning given for this decision (""he thought his music was beginning to sound too much like Black Label Society"") is clearly Ozzy's opinion about Zakk Wylde's music, not Zakk Wylde's opinion about his own music. Therefore, ""he"" in this context must refer to Ozzy.",0,0

1. Jane is mentioned first in the sentence, making her the primary subject.
2. The sentence structure suggests that Jane is the one who wants to marry Constance.
3. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the context of not being able to forget ""her husband,"" which implies that this person was previously married.
4. It's more logical that Jane, who wants to marry Constance, is the one struggling with memories of a past marriage, rather than Constance herself.

1. Andrea is the subject of the sentence and the main person making a decision.
2. Miranda is mentioned as one of the options Andrea is considering.
3. The pronoun ""her"" is used in the phrase ""her friend.""

Given this information, we can conclude that ""her"" most likely refers to Andrea. This is because:
1. Andrea is the main subject of the sentence, making her the most likely antecedent for pronouns.
2. The phrase ""her friend"" implies ownership or association, which logically connects to Andrea as she's the one making the decision.
3. It wouldn't make sense for ""her friend"" to refer to Miranda's friend, as the context is about Andrea's decision.

1. Barbara is the subject of the main clause, telling Melissa to do something.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the subordinate clause, indicating an action that will happen in the future (speaking to Krausert).
3. It's more likely that Barbara, as the one giving instructions, would be the one to speak to Krausert later.
4. If Melissa were to speak to Krausert, it would contradict Barbara's instruction to ""say no more.""

Given these points, it's most logical that ""she"" refers to Barbara, as she is the one likely to speak to Krausert in the future, while Melissa has been told to say nothing more.",0,0

1081,"Coonan only knew Featherstone casually, but he gave him his handgun without question.",he,"0: Coonan, 1: Featherstone, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Coonan only knew Featherstone casually""
2. The second part of the sentence uses ""he"" and ""him""
3. ""he gave him his handgun"" implies that one person (the subject) gave a handgun to another person (the object)
4. Since Coonan is mentioned first and is the subject of the first clause, it's more likely that ""he"" refers to Coonan
5. This interpretation makes sense because if ""he"" referred to Featherstone, the sentence would be confusing and illogical

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Coonan.",0,0
1082,"Johnny is determined to win Alfie back, but he is now in a relationship with Little Mo..",he,"0: Johnny, 1: Alfie, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Johnny is determined to win Alfie back.""
2. The second part of the sentence uses ""he"" and states ""he is now in a relationship with Little Mo.""

Given this information, we can deduce:

- Johnny is trying to win Alfie back, which implies that Alfie is no longer with Johnny.
- The pronoun ""he"" is more likely to refer to Alfie because:
  a) Alfie is the most recently mentioned person before the pronoun.
  b) It makes more sense in the context that Alfie is now in a relationship with Little Mo, as this explains why Johnny is trying to win him back.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Alfie.",1,1

The pronoun ""her"" in this context is most likely referring to Rebecca for the following reasons:
1. Kat is the subject of the sentence and is doing the forgiving.

1. The sentence describes two actions: Jill being killed and someone being stabbed.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the second part of the sentence, referring to the person who is stabbed.
3. Logically, if Jill is killed upon encountering Michaela, she cannot be the one who is stabbed afterwards.
4. Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Michaela, who is presumably stabbed after the encounter with Jill.

1085,"Christina was concerned that Clara was unmarried, and so she suggested the match.",she,"0: Christina, 1: Christina, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" refers to Christina. The reasoning is as follows:

1. The sentence structure indicates that Christina is the subject of the first clause and the main actor in the sentence.
2. Christina is described as being concerned about Clara's marital status.
3. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the second part of the sentence to describe an action (suggesting the match) that logically follows from Christina's concern.
4. It makes more sense for Christina to suggest a match for Clara, given that Christina is the one who is concerned about Clara's unmarried status.

3. The pronoun ""him"" is the object of the verb ""urges,"" indicating that Mark is urging someone else.
4. The only other person mentioned in the sentence is Joe.

The pronoun ""they"" is more likely to refer to ""The clowns"" for the following reasons:
1. It's more logical that the clowns would be the ones urinating on the detectives' car, which would then lead to the detectives pursuing them.
2. If ""they"" referred to the detectives, it wouldn't make sense for the detectives to pursue the clowns after urinating on their own car.
3. The sentence structure suggests that the action of urinating on the car is the reason for the pursuit, which aligns with the clowns being the ones performing this action.

Therefore, the pronoun ""they"" most likely refers to ""The clowns"".",1,1
1089,Maertens said Gimondi won because he pushed him into the barriers at the finish.,he,"0: Maertens, 1: Gimondi, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""he"" refers to. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""he pushed him into the barriers at the finish."" Given the context, it's clear that Maertens is making a statement about Gimondi's actions. Therefore, ""he"" must refer to Gimondi, as Maertens is accusing Gimondi of pushing him (Maertens) into the barriers. This interpretation makes the most logical sense in the context of the statement.",0,1
1090,"Tiberius married James, but he first had to divorce Vipsania Agrippina, the woman he dearly loved.",he,"0: Tiberius, 1: James, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Tiberius for the following reasons:

1. Tiberius is mentioned first in the sentence, making him the primary subject.
2. The sentence structure indicates that the person who married James is the same person who had to divorce Vipsania Agrippina.
3. The phrase ""he first had to divorce"" implies that this action was taken by Tiberius before marrying James.
4. It's more logical that Tiberius would be the one divorcing Vipsania Agrippina, as she is described as ""the woman he dearly loved,"" suggesting a previous relationship.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Tiberius.",0,0
1091,"Samuel tries to throw himself at Wayne, but he's wary after all his bad experiences with men.",he,"0: Samuel, 1: Wayne, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Samuel tries to throw himself at Wayne"".
2. Then it continues with ""but he's wary after all his bad experiences with men"".

The pronoun ""he"" in this case is more likely to refer to Wayne because:

1. Wayne is the object of Samuel's action (Samuel is throwing himself at Wayne).
2. The sentence uses ""but"" to introduce a contrasting idea, which suggests a shift in focus from Samuel to Wayne.
3. The phrase ""wary after all his bad experiences with men"" implies that this person has had multiple negative experiences with men. This is more likely to describe Wayne's perspective, as Samuel is actively pursuing Wayne.

Therefore, based on the context and sentence structure, ""he"" most likely refers to Wayne.",1,1
1092,"Leonardo continued to be there for Bill though, and he even bent over backwards trying to help him when he lost his eyesight in an explosion.",him,"0: Leonardo, 1: Bill, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""him"" is used twice, and in both cases, it refers to Bill. Let's break it down:

1. ""Leonardo continued to be there for Bill"" - This establishes that Leonardo is helping Bill.
2. ""he even bent over backwards trying to help him"" - Here, ""he"" refers to Leonardo (the subject of the sentence), and ""him"" refers to Bill (the object of Leonardo's help).
3. ""when he lost his eyesight in an explosion"" - This ""he"" also refers to Bill, as it's describing what happened to the person Leonardo was helping.

The pronoun ""him"" is clearly referring to Bill in this context, as Bill is the recipient of Leonardo's help and the one who lost his eyesight.",1,1
1093,"An apologetic Bella tried to caress and comfort Lizzie, but she was still upset with her, and tried to just bluntly tell her there was no baby.",she,"0: Lizzie, 1: An apologetic Bella, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""she"" the pronoun refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. ""An apologetic Bella tried to caress and comfort Lizzie"" - This establishes Bella as the active subject and Lizzie as the object of her actions.

2. ""but she was still upset with her"" - This is where the pronoun ""she"" appears. Given the context, it's more likely that this ""she"" refers to Lizzie because:
   a) Lizzie is the one being comforted, suggesting she's upset.
   b) The sentence structure implies a contrast (""but"") to Bella's actions, indicating a shift in focus to Lizzie's reaction.

3. ""and tried to just bluntly tell her there was no baby"" - This further supports that ""she"" refers to Lizzie, as it continues to describe her actions in response to Bella's attempt at comfort.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Lizzie.",0,"0

1094,"Disillusioned, Belle attempts to imprison Sarah, but she tells him that only a Wiccan could defeat her.",she,"0: Sarah, 1: Belle, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""she"" refers to: Sarah or Belle. Let's analyze the context:

1. Belle is attempting to imprison Sarah.
2. ""She"" tells ""him"" something.

The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""she tells him"". Since Belle is referred to as ""him"" in this clause, ""she"" must refer to the other person mentioned, which is Sarah. Sarah is the one telling Belle (him) that only a Wiccan could defeat her.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" refers to Sarah in this context.",0,0
1095,"According to Ali, Osmani was not promoted because he was Bengali and deemed untrustworthy by the high command.",he,"0: Osmani, 1: Ali, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Osmani. The context clearly indicates that Osmani was the one who was not promoted, and the reason given is that ""he was Bengali and deemed untrustworthy."" This description applies to Osmani, not Ali. Ali is mentioned as the source of this information, but he is not the subject of the pronoun ""he"" in this context.",1,0
1096,"Clark proposed to Albert but he turned him down, saying he was too set in his ways.",he,"0: Clark, 1: Albert, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. ""Clark proposed to Albert"" - This establishes that Clark is the one who proposed.

2. ""but he turned him down"" - Here, ""he"" refers to Albert, and ""him"" refers to Clark. This is because Albert is the one doing the action of turning down, and Clark is the one being turned down.

3. ""saying he was too set in his ways"" - This ""he"" is most likely referring to the same person as the previous ""he"", which we determined to be Albert. It makes more sense that Albert would be explaining his reason for turning down the proposal.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" in this context refers to Albert.",1,1
1097,"Jenny goes to stay with Carol after she is taken ill, but he suffers a stroke while he is there.",she,"0: Jenny, 1: Carol, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. ""Jenny goes to stay with Carol"" - This establishes that Jenny is visiting Carol.
2. ""after she is taken ill"" - The pronoun ""she"" here refers to the person who is ill.
3. ""but he suffers a stroke while he is there"" - This introduces a new subject ""he"" who suffers a stroke. This ""he"" is not related to the pronoun ""she"" we're asked about.

The question is specifically about the pronoun ""she"" in this context. Given that Jenny is going to stay with Carol, and someone is ill, it makes more sense that Carol is the one who is ill. If Jenny were ill, she would likely stay at home rather than go to stay with someone else.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" in ""after she is taken ill"" most likely refers to Carol.",1,1
1098,Marguerite can not understand how Patricia is so drastically different from the woman whom she married.,she,"0: Marguerite, 1: Patricia, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which person the pronoun ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence is about Marguerite's perception of Patricia.
2. Marguerite is the subject of the main clause, and she is the one who ""can not understand.""
3. Patricia is mentioned as the object of Marguerite's lack of understanding.
4. The pronoun ""she"" appears in the phrase ""the woman whom she married.""

Given this context, it's clear that ""she"" refers to Marguerite. The sentence is describing Marguerite's perspective on Patricia, and it's Marguerite who married Patricia (or at least, the version of Patricia that Marguerite remembers). Therefore, ""she"" in ""the woman whom she married"" must refer to Marguerite.",0,0
1099,"Joan is in a relationship with Hollywood lawyer Georgina Savitt, but her career is in a bit of a downswing.",her,"0: Joan, 1: Hollywood lawyer Georgina Savitt, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""her"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence is primarily about Joan, as she is mentioned first and is the subject of the main clause.
2. Georgina Savitt is mentioned as Joan's partner, but she is not the main focus of the sentence.
3. The pronoun ""her"" is used in the phrase ""her career is in a bit of a downswing.""
4. It's more likely that the sentence is discussing Joan's career rather than Georgina Savitt's, as Joan is the primary subject of the sentence.

Given these points, it's most logical to conclude that ""her"" refers to Joan, as the sentence is primarily about Joan and her current situation, including her relationship and career status.",0,0
1100,"At first, Glenda appears excited to see Daisy; but immediately she starts yelling that she can't just drop in and everything will be all right.",she,"0: Daisy, 1: Glenda, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""At first, Glenda appears excited to see Daisy;""
2. Then it continues with ""but immediately she starts yelling...""

The pronoun ""she"" is more likely to refer to Glenda for the following reasons:
1. Glenda is the subject of the first part of the sentence, making her the more prominent actor.
2. The sentence describes a change in Glenda's behavior (from excited to yelling), which logically follows that ""she"" would refer to Glenda.
3. It wouldn't make sense for Daisy to start yelling immediately after being seen, as she is the one dropping in.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Glenda.",1,1
1101,"White has published a book about Cardinal Bernardin, but he has yet to publish a book of his work outside the religious realm.",he,"0: White, 1: Cardinal Bernardin, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who the pronoun ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. White has published a book about Cardinal Bernardin.
2. ""he"" has yet to publish a book outside the religious realm.

The pronoun ""he"" is more likely to refer to White for the following reasons:
- The sentence is primarily about White's publishing activities.
- It would be unusual to mention Cardinal Bernardin's publishing activities in this context, especially since he is the subject of White's book.
- The structure of the sentence suggests that we're continuing to talk about White's work, transitioning from his published book to his potential future publications.

Therefore, it is most logical that ""he"" refers to White in this context.",1,0
1102,"James tries hard to seduce Wallace without magic, but though he is strongly attracted to him, he refuses to put off his marriage.",he,"0: James, 1: Wallace, 2: Neither","In this sentence, there are two instances of the pronoun ""he"". Let's analyze them separately:

1. ""...but though he is strongly attracted to him...""
   This ""he"" likely refers to Wallace, as James is trying to seduce Wallace, and it makes more sense that Wallace would be the one attracted to James in this context.

2. ""...he refuses to put off his marriage.""
   This ""he"" is more ambiguous. It could refer to either James or Wallace, as we don't have enough context to determine whose marriage is being discussed.

Given that the question asks about a single instance of ""he"" without specifying which one, and considering that one instance clearly refers to Wallace while the other is ambiguous, the most reasonable conclusion is that the pronoun ""he"" in this context refers to Wallace.",1,1
1103,Sudesh Berry was considered for the role of Rahul but after a screen test the director decided he didn't fit the role.,he,"0: Rahul, 1: Sudesh Berry, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Sudesh Berry. The context indicates that Sudesh Berry was considered for a role, but after a screen test, the director decided that ""he"" (Sudesh Berry) didn't fit the role. The pronoun ""he"" is used to avoid repeating Sudesh Berry's name in the second part of the sentence. It cannot refer to Rahul because Rahul is the name of the role, not a person being considered for it.",0,1
1104,The men survived with the help of Aborigines until they were rescued in September by Alfred William Howitt.,they,"0: The men, 1: Aborigines, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" most likely refers to ""The men"" for the following reasons:

1. ""The men"" is the subject of the sentence and the main focus of the narrative.
2. The sentence structure suggests that ""The men"" are the ones who survived and were rescued.
3. The Aborigines are mentioned as helping ""The men,"" indicating that they are a separate group from the main subject.
4. The rescue by Alfred William Howitt is described as happening to ""they,"" which contextually makes more sense if referring to ""The men"" who needed rescuing.

While the Aborigines are mentioned, they are described as helping rather than being the ones rescued, making it less likely that ""they"" refers to them.",0,0
1105,James is trying to run away from Jasper but the cat keeps grabbing the mouse's tail to keep him from running anywhere.,him,"0: James, 1: Jasper, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""him"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. James is trying to run away from Jasper.
2. The cat keeps grabbing the mouse's tail.
3. The cat is trying to keep ""him"" from running anywhere.

Based on this information, we can deduce that:
- James is the mouse (trying to run away)
- Jasper is the cat (grabbing the mouse's tail)

The pronoun ""him"" is used in the context of someone trying to run away, which aligns with James (the mouse) attempting to escape. Therefore, ""him"" refers to James.",1,0
1106,Fellows did challenge Stewart on the final restart but all of his speed was worn out by his charge through the field.,his,"0: Fellows, 1: Stewart, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""his"" refers to Fellows, not Stewart. The context suggests that Fellows was challenging Stewart on the final restart, and it was Fellows' speed that was worn out by charging through the field. This interpretation makes the most logical sense given the structure of the sentence.",1,0
1107,"Lubaba wounded Abu Lahab so severely that his head was split open, laying bare part of his skull.",his,"0: Lubaba, 1: Abu Lahab, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""his"" refers to Abu Lahab for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure indicates that Lubaba is the subject performing the action (wounding), while Abu Lahab is the object receiving the action.

2. The pronoun ""his"" is used in the clause describing the result of the wounding, which logically would refer to the person who was wounded (Abu Lahab).

3. The description of the head being split open and the skull being exposed is clearly referring to the person who was severely wounded, which is Abu Lahab.

4. It would not make sense for ""his"" to refer to Lubaba in this context, as Lubaba is the one inflicting the wound, not receiving it.

Therefore, the pronoun ""his"" most likely refers to Abu Lahab (candidate 1).",1,1
1108,"Carlos tries to win Jim back, but he rebuffs him, saying he is going to marry Gilberte.",he,"0: Carlos, 1: Jim, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""he"" the pronoun refers to. Let's break it down:

1. Carlos tries to win Jim back
2. But ""he"" rebuffs ""him""
3. Saying ""he"" is going to marry Gilberte

The first ""he"" in the sentence is clearly referring to Jim, as Jim is the one rebuffing Carlos (who is trying to win Jim back). The second ""he"" also refers to Jim, as it's continuing the same action of rebuffing and explaining why (because he, Jim, is going to marry Gilberte).

Therefore, both instances of ""he"" in this sentence refer to Jim.",1,1
1109,"Mike asks Eric if he really can fly, and he smiles and nods his head.",he,"0: Mike, 1: Eric, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""he"" is being referred to. Let's break it down:

1. Mike asks Eric if he really can fly
2. and he smiles and nods his head

The first ""he"" in ""if he really can fly"" is ambiguous and could refer to either Mike or Eric. However, the second ""he"" in ""he smiles and nods his head"" is more likely to refer to Eric. This is because:

1. Eric is the person being asked about flying.
2. The smiling and nodding is a response to the question, which makes more sense coming from Eric (the person being asked) rather than Mike (the person asking).

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" in this context most likely refers to Eric.",1,1
1110,"Black is forced to play into White's hands, whether he likes it or not.",he,"0: Black, 1: White 's hands, 2: Neither","In this context, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Black. The sentence is describing a situation in chess where Black (the player controlling the black pieces) is forced to make a move that benefits White (the player controlling the white pieces), regardless of Black's preferences. The phrase ""whether he likes it or not"" is referring to Black's lack of choice in the matter. It wouldn't make sense for ""he"" to refer to ""White's hands"" as hands are not typically personified in this way, and ""White's hands"" is used metaphorically to represent White's advantage or strategy.",0,0
1111,"Jany attempts to have one last liaison with Mirabelle before leaving, but she spurns her due to her relationship with Ray.",she,"0: Jany, 1: Mirabelle, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""she"" the pronoun refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Jany is attempting to have a liaison with Mirabelle.
2. ""She"" spurns ""her"" due to her relationship with Ray.

The pronoun ""she"" in this context is more likely to refer to Mirabelle because:
1. Mirabelle is the object of Jany's attempt at a liaison.
2. It makes more sense that Mirabelle would spurn Jany's advances due to her (Mirabelle's) relationship with Ray.
3. If ""she"" referred to Jany, it would mean Jany is spurning herself, which doesn't make logical sense in this context.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Mirabelle.",1,1
1112,The soldiers seemed to accept and blasted the Terrorcons - but when the smoke cleared they had merely shot around them.,they,"0: The soldiers, 1: the Terrorcons, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which group ""they"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence starts with ""The soldiers seemed to accept and blasted the Terrorcons.""
2. Then it says ""but when the smoke cleared they had merely shot around them.""

The pronoun ""they"" is used in the context of who had ""merely shot around them."" Given the structure of the sentence, it's clear that the soldiers are the ones who did the shooting. The Terrorcons are the targets of the action, not the performers.

Therefore, ""they"" in this context refers to the soldiers, as they are the ones who appeared to accept and blast the Terrorcons, but actually shot around them.",0,0
1113,Thorne finally identifies Bruce Wayne after he acquires photos of him changing costume from reporter Vicki Vale.,him,"0: Thorne, 1: Bruce Wayne, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""him"" refers to Bruce Wayne. The context indicates that Thorne identifies Bruce Wayne after acquiring photos of ""him"" changing costume. Since Bruce Wayne is known for changing into his Batman costume, it makes sense that the photos would be of Bruce Wayne, not Thorne. Additionally, the sentence structure suggests that ""him"" refers back to ""Bruce Wayne"" as the object of identification.",1,1
1114,"The mercenaries manage to capture the drug lords, but their men are trying to set them free.",their,"0: The mercenaries, 1: the drug lords, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""their"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and logical flow of the sentence.

1. The sentence describes two groups: the mercenaries and the drug lords.
2. The first part of the sentence states that ""The mercenaries manage to capture the drug lords.""
3. The second part of the sentence says ""but their men are trying to set them free.""

Given this information, we can deduce that:
- The mercenaries have captured the drug lords.
- Someone's men are trying to set the captured individuals free.

It wouldn't make sense for the mercenaries' own men to try to free the drug lords they just captured. Therefore, ""their"" most likely refers to the drug lords. The drug lords' men are attempting to free the captured drug lords.",1,1
1115,"D'valos may have listened to the tempter, but in act he was loyal.",he,"0: D'valos, 1: the tempter, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" clearly refers to D'valos. The sentence is describing D'valos's actions and loyalty, contrasting his potential listening to the tempter with his actual loyal behavior. The pronoun ""he"" is used to continue referring to D'valos in the second part of the sentence, maintaining him as the subject. The tempter is mentioned only as a secondary character that D'valos may have listened to, but is not the main subject of the sentence.",1,0

The context indicates that Brihaspati is asking Vayu to transport ""him"" through the air. Since Brihaspati is the one making the request, it's logical that he is asking to be transported, not Vayu. Therefore, ""him"" refers to Brihaspati.",1,0
1117,"Kai loses the subsequent match against Spencer, but he was proud to longer be Voltaire's puppet.",he,"0: Kai, 1: Spencer, 2: Neither","The pronoun ""he"" in this sentence refers to Kai for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure suggests that the subject of the second clause is the same as the subject of the first clause, which is Kai.

2. The context of the sentence is about Kai's feelings after the match, not Spencer's.

3. The phrase ""no longer be Voltaire's puppet"" implies a personal development or change for Kai, which is more likely to be associated with Kai's feelings of pride rather than Spencer's.

4. It would not make sense for Spencer to be proud of no longer being Voltaire's puppet, as there's no indication that Spencer was ever associated with Voltaire.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Kai.",1,0
1118,"At first Lucy seems untrusting of Cecil, but like the other dwarves, she learns to accept her.",she,"0: Cecil, 1: Lucy, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine whether the pronoun ""she"" refers to Lucy or Cecil. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence starts by mentioning Lucy's initial attitude towards Cecil.
2. Then it mentions ""the other dwarves,"" implying that Lucy is one of the dwarves.
3. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the phrase ""she learns to accept her.""

Given this information, it's clear that Lucy is the subject who is learning to accept Cecil. The pronoun ""she"" refers to Lucy, who is changing her attitude from untrusting to accepting. Cecil is the object being accepted, referred to as ""her"" at the end of the sentence.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" refers to Lucy.",1,1
1119,"Armstrong managed to get away from Ullrich, but he could not further overtake Laiseka and Cardenas.",he,"0: Armstrong, 1: Ullrich, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" clearly refers to Armstrong. The sentence structure indicates that Armstrong is the subject who ""managed to get away from Ullrich"" and then ""could not further overtake Laiseka and Cardenas."" The pronoun ""he"" is used to continue referring to Armstrong's actions without repeating his name. Ullrich is mentioned only as the person Armstrong got away from, not as the main subject of the sentence.",0,0
1120,Buffy tells Susan not to leave because she isn't ready for him not to be there.,she,"0: Buffy, 1: Susan, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Buffy is telling Susan not to leave.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""she isn't ready for him not to be there.""

The most logical interpretation is that Buffy is the one who isn't ready for Susan to leave. This makes sense because:

a) Buffy is the subject of the main clause (Buffy tells Susan).
b) The pronoun ""she"" is more likely to refer to the subject of the sentence.
c) The sentiment of not being ready for someone to leave aligns with Buffy's action of telling Susan not to leave.

Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Buffy.",0,0
1121,"Bob soon moved into the boarding house to try to get away from Bradley, but he got a court order and forced him to return home.",he,"0: Bob, 1: Bradley, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and the logical flow of the sentence.

1. The sentence starts with ""Bob soon moved into the boarding house...""
2. The reason for this move is ""to try to get away from Bradley""
3. Then we encounter the pronoun ""he"": ""but he got a court order""
4. The action of getting a court order is more likely to be associated with Bradley, as he's trying to force Bob to return home.
5. This is confirmed by the last part of the sentence: ""and forced him to return home""

Given this analysis, it's clear that ""he"" refers to Bradley, not Bob. Bradley is the one who got the court order and forced Bob to return home. This aligns with the initial context of Bob trying to get away from Bradley.",1,1
1122,"Albert had become extremely protective of Phillip and when he found out about the rape, he made sure Bradley was arrested.",he,"0: Albert, 1: Phillip, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. The first part of the sentence establishes that Albert is protective of Phillip.
2. The second part of the sentence uses ""he"" to describe someone who ""made sure Bradley was arrested"" after finding out about the rape.

Given that Albert is described as ""extremely protective"" of Phillip, it makes the most sense that Albert would be the one to take action and ensure Bradley's arrest. The pronoun ""he"" is most likely referring to Albert in this context.

Phillip is mentioned as the person Albert is protective of, but there's no indication that Phillip took any action. Bradley is only mentioned as the person who was arrested, so ""he"" cannot refer to Bradley.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Albert.",1,0
1123,"Chris angrily rejected Phillip, but he didn't tell Lujack the reason because he did not want to cause any more bad blood between them.",he,"0: Chris, 1: Phillip, 2: Neither","In this sentence, there are two instances of 'he'. Let's analyze them separately:

1. The first 'he' in 'he didn't tell Lujack the reason' likely refers to Chris. This is because Chris is the subject of the first clause ('Chris angrily rejected Phillip'), and it's more natural for the narrative to continue from Chris's perspective.

2. The second 'he' in 'he did not want to cause any more bad blood' also likely refers to Chris for the same reason. It's a continuation of Chris's actions and motivations.

Given that both instances of 'he' seem to refer to Chris, and the question is about which candidate the pronoun refers to, the answer is Chris.",0,0
1124,"Phillip believed Chris to be dead, so he moved on with the scheming Blake Thorpe.",he,"0: Phillip, 1: Chris, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Phillip believed Chris to be dead""
2. Then it continues with ""so he moved on with the scheming Blake Thorpe""

The pronoun ""he"" is used in the second part of the sentence, which describes an action taken as a result of believing Chris to be dead. Logically, the person who would ""move on"" after believing someone is dead would be the person who held that belief.

In this case, Phillip is the one who believed Chris to be dead. Therefore, it makes sense that Phillip would be the one to ""move on"" with Blake Thorpe.

Chris, being the person believed to be dead, would not be the one moving on with someone else.

Based on this reasoning, ""he"" most likely refers to Phillip.",0,0
1125,"Instantly suspicious, Timmy confronts Norris and asks if he is a transvestite.",he,"0: Norris, 1: Timmy, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" clearly refers to Norris. The context indicates that Timmy is confronting Norris and asking him a question. The pronoun ""he"" is used in reference to the person being asked the question, which is Norris. Timmy is the one doing the asking, so he cannot be referring to himself with ""he"" in this context.",0,0
1126,"Buffy doesn't want Rebecca to feel unwanted, so she offers to let her help her with the spell.",she,"0: Buffy, 1: Rebecca, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""she"" refers to Buffy or Rebecca. Let's break down the sentence:

1. ""Buffy doesn't want Rebecca to feel unwanted"" - This establishes Buffy as the subject and Rebecca as the object.
2. ""so she offers to let her help her with the spell"" - This is where we need to identify the pronoun references.

The first ""she"" in this part of the sentence is the subject performing the action of offering. Given the context of the first part of the sentence, it's clear that Buffy is the one who doesn't want Rebecca to feel unwanted. Therefore, Buffy is the one making the offer.

The subsequent ""her"" pronouns refer to Rebecca, as she is the one being offered to help and the one who might feel unwanted.

So, the ""she"" in question refers to Buffy.",0,0
1127,"Vince Lombardi later congratulated Robinson, but in the next breath he criticized him for being out of his assigned position.",him,"0: Robinson, 1: Vince Lombardi, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""him"" clearly refers to Robinson. The context indicates that Vince Lombardi is the one performing the actions (congratulating and criticizing), while Robinson is the recipient of these actions.

1. The sentence mentions two people: Bryce and Andrew.
2. The pronoun ""his"" is used in the phrase ""his husband leaves him.""
3. The sentence structure suggests that Andrew is the one who has started drinking again.
4. It's more likely that the consequences of drinking (i.e., a husband leaving) would apply to the person who is drinking.
5. Therefore, ""his husband"" is more likely to refer to Andrew's husband, not Bryce's.

Based on this analysis, the pronoun ""his"" most likely refers to Andrew.",1,1
1129,"At first suspicious, Bryce decides to break up with Chuck when he tries to propose.",he,"0: Bryce, 1: Chuck, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Chuck. The context suggests that Chuck is the one trying to propose, which is the action associated with the pronoun ""he."" Bryce is the subject of the sentence, deciding to break up with Chuck, while Chuck is the one performing the action of proposing. Therefore, ""he"" refers to Chuck.",1,1
1130,"Cassandra calls on Wanda, but she kills her and then turns his eyes to Nino.",she,"0: Cassandra, 1: Wanda, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. ""Cassandra calls on Wanda"" - This establishes the two main characters in the sentence.
2. ""but she kills her"" - This is where the pronoun ""she"" appears.
3. The pronoun ""she"" is performing the action of killing.
4. ""her"" likely refers to the person being killed, which would be the other person mentioned (not ""she"").
5. Given the structure of the sentence, it's more logical that Wanda (the person being called on) is the one who does the killing, rather than Cassandra (the one doing the calling).

Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Wanda (candidate 1).",1,1
1131,"Liana quickly becomes enamoured with Abby, but she subtly resists her sexual innuendos to ensure that her mission is not compromised.",her,"0: Liana, 1: Abby, 2: Neither","In this sentence, there are two instances of the pronoun 'her'. Let's analyze them separately:

1. '...she subtly resists her sexual innuendos...'
   In this case, 'her' refers to Abby. Liana is resisting Abby's sexual innuendos.

2. '...to ensure that her mission is not compromised.'
   This 'her' refers to Liana. It's Liana's mission that is being discussed.

The question asks about the pronoun 'her' without specifying which instance. However, since Liana is the subject of the sentence and the one whose actions are being described (becoming enamoured, resisting, ensuring), it's more likely that the 'her' in question refers to Liana's mission. Therefore, the pronoun 'her' most likely refers to Liana.",0,0
1132,Mrs Poirot wires back to arrest Mrs Middleton at once but she disappears before this can happen.,she,"0: Mrs Middleton, 1: Mrs Poirot, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, let's analyze the sentence:

""Mrs Poirot wires back to arrest Mrs Middleton at once but she disappears before this can happen.""

The pronoun ""she"" is more likely to refer to Mrs Middleton for the following reasons:

1. Mrs Middleton is the object of the arrest order, making her the focus of the action.
2. The sentence structure suggests that ""she"" is the person who is supposed to be arrested.
3. It would make more sense in the context that the person being pursued (Mrs Middleton) is the one who disappears, rather than the person ordering the arrest (Mrs Poirot).

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Mrs Middleton.",0,0
1133,"Sally becomes attracted to Bella, but she is disappointed to learn she is marrying Emily Vincent.",she,"0: Sally, 1: Bella, 2: Neither","In this sentence, there are two instances of the pronoun ""she"". We need to determine which ""she"" the question is referring to and then identify who that ""she"" represents.

The first ""she"" in the sentence is likely referring to Sally, as it follows the structure ""Sally becomes attracted to Bella, but she..."" This ""she"" is the subject experiencing disappointment.

The second ""she"" in ""she is marrying Emily Vincent"" is more likely referring to Bella. This makes sense in the context of the sentence, as Sally would be disappointed to learn that Bella (the person she's attracted to) is marrying someone else.

Given that we're asked about ""she"" without specifying which one, and the question is about who the pronoun refers to, we should consider both instances. In this case, ""she"" refers to both Sally and Bella at different points in the sentence.

However, since we're asked to choose between Sally and Bella, and both are referred to by ""she"" at some point, we cannot definitively choose one over the other.",1,"2

1134,"Sally proposes to Whitney that if she helps her kill Tobias Beecher, he will pay her handsomely and keep her secret.",she,"0: Sally, 1: Whitney, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. Sally is the subject of the sentence and the one proposing the deal.
2. Whitney is the person to whom Sally is proposing the deal.
3. The pronoun ""she"" appears twice in the sentence:
   - First ""she"": ""if she helps her kill Tobias Beecher""
   - Second ""she"": ""he will pay her handsomely and keep her secret""

For the first ""she,"" it makes more sense that Whitney would be the one helping Sally, not Sally helping herself. This interpretation is supported by the use of ""her"" immediately after, which likely refers to Sally (as in ""help her [Sally] kill Tobias Beecher"").

For the second instance, ""he will pay her,"" the ""her"" most likely refers to Whitney, as she would be the one being paid for her help.

Given this analysis, the pronoun ""she"" in this context most likely refers to Whitney (candidate 1).",1,
1135,Reedburn was in love with Victor although his feelings were not reciprocated.,his,"0: Reedburn, 1: Victor, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""his"" refers to. The pronoun ""his"" is used to indicate possession or belonging to a male person. 

Let's analyze the sentence:
""Reedburn was in love with Victor although his feelings were not reciprocated.""

The key points are:
1. Reedburn is in love with Victor.
2. Someone's feelings are not reciprocated.

Given the structure of the sentence, it's most logical that ""his feelings"" refers to Reedburn's feelings. This is because:
1. Reedburn is the subject of the sentence and the one described as being in love.
2. The phrase ""although his feelings were not reciprocated"" implies that these feelings belong to the person who is in love.
3. If ""his"" referred to Victor, the sentence would not make logical sense, as Victor is not described as having feelings that aren't reciprocated.

Therefore, ""his"" most likely refers to Reedburn.",0,0
1136,Nolan makes a move on Tom but he swears he does not want anything more and tells him he loves his wife.,he,"0: Nolan, 1: Tom, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. ""Nolan makes a move on Tom"" - This establishes Nolan as the initiator of the action.
2. ""but he swears he does not want anything more"" - This ""he"" is likely referring to Tom, as he would be the one to respond to Nolan's move.
3. ""and tells him he loves his wife"" - This further supports that Tom is the one speaking, as he's telling Nolan (referred to as ""him"") that he loves his own wife.

The pronoun ""he"" in question is most likely referring to Tom because:
1. It's Tom who would naturally respond to Nolan's move.
2. The context suggests Tom is the one swearing he doesn't want more and declaring love for his wife.
3. It makes more sense in the narrative for Tom to be rejecting Nolan's advances rather than Nolan rejecting his own actions.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Tom.",1,"1

1. Rania is trying to comfort Julia.
2. ""She"" accuses ""her"" of being a heartless administrator.

Given this information, it's more likely that Julia is the one doing the accusing. This is because:

1. Rania is the one comforting, so it wouldn't make sense for her to then accuse Julia.
2. Julia is the one being comforted, which suggests she's in an emotional state that might lead to an accusation.
3. The pronoun ""her"" in ""accuses her"" likely refers back to Rania, which means ""she"" must be Julia.

Therefore, ""she"" in this sentence most likely refers to Julia.",1,1

1. The first ""he"" in the sentence clearly refers to Julian, as it states ""Julian is thrilled when Adam is acquitted.""

2. The second ""he"" is the one we're focusing on: ""but he is later horrified to learn...""

3. The sentence structure suggests that this ""he"" is the same person who was thrilled earlier, which was Julian.

4. The context about signing an agreement with Rebecca and being prevented from divorcing her also implies that this ""he"" is Julian, as he seems to be in a marriage with Rebecca.

5. There's no indication that Adam is involved in any agreement or marriage situation with Rebecca.

Given these points, it's clear that the pronoun ""he"" in question refers to Julian, not Adam.",0,0

1. Rahul is the subject of the first clause, intending to surprise Paul.
2. The pronoun ""his"" appears in the second clause, referring to someone's arrival.
3. Given the structure of the sentence, it's more likely that ""his"" refers to Rahul's arrival, as he is the one performing the action of intending to surprise Paul.
4. It wouldn't make sense for ""his"" to refer to Paul's arrival, as Paul is the one being surprised.
5. The sentence implies that Rahul arrived to find Paul in Karan's arms, further supporting that ""his"" refers to Rahul's arrival.

Based on this analysis, the pronoun ""his"" most likely refers to Rahul.",0,0

The context suggests that Allyson is the one performing the action of rushing to find Delilah and then speaking to her the following morning. The pronoun ""she"" is used to continue describing Allyson's actions, indicating that Allyson is the one who ""only manages to speak to her the following morning."" Therefore, ""she"" refers to Allyson (candidate 0) in this context.",0,0

The pronoun ""she"" is used in the context of resisting advances. The sentence structure indicates that Tamarah is making advances on Karen, and then ""she resists."" Logically, the person resisting would be the one receiving the advances, not the one making them. Therefore, ""she"" in this case refers to Karen, who is resisting Tamarah's advances due to her attachment to Brian.",1,1

1. The sentence starts with ""Mr. MacKenzie is often frosty towards Jack.""
2. Then it continues with ""but he refuses to give up on him.""

The pronoun ""he"" is more likely to refer to Mr. MacKenzie for the following reasons:
1. Mr. MacKenzie is the subject of the first clause, making him the more prominent character in the sentence.
2. The sentence structure suggests a contrast between Mr. MacKenzie's frosty behavior and his refusal to give up, which implies that ""he"" is the same person as Mr. MacKenzie.
3. The phrase ""give up on him"" likely refers to Jack, as it makes more sense for Mr. MacKenzie to not give up on Jack despite being frosty towards him, rather than Jack not giving up on Mr. MacKenzie.

Therefore, ""he"" most likely refers to Mr. MacKenzie.",0,1
1143,"Sonny apologizes to Jimmy, but he is so upset that he takes one of the new cars and races it out of the convention center.",he,"0: Sonny, 1: Jimmy, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""he"" refers to: Sonny or Jimmy. Let's analyze the context:

1. Sonny apologizes to Jimmy.
2. ""He"" is so upset.
3. ""He"" takes one of the new cars and races it out of the convention center.

Given this information, it's more likely that ""he"" refers to Sonny for the following reasons:

1. Sonny is the subject of the first clause, making him the more prominent character in the sentence.
2. The act of apologizing usually doesn't make the person receiving the apology (Jimmy) upset. It's more likely that Sonny is upset, perhaps about the situation that led to the apology.
3. The action of taking a car and racing it out seems more consistent with someone who is upset (Sonny) rather than someone who just received an apology (Jimmy).

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Sonny.",1,0
1144,"Martin found Charles common and repulsive, but since he advertised himself as the owner of a palatial estate, he agreed to marry him.",he,"0: Martin, 1: Charles, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Martin found Charles common and repulsive...""
2. The pronoun ""he"" appears in the phrase ""he agreed to marry him.""
3. The subject of the verb ""agreed"" is the same person who found Charles repulsive.
4. Therefore, ""he"" must refer to Martin, as Martin is the one who made the decision to marry despite finding Charles repulsive.
5. The use of ""him"" at the end of the sentence confirms that Charles is the object of the marriage, not the subject.

Based on this analysis, we can conclude that the pronoun ""he"" refers to Martin.",1,0
1145,"Paul is initially hostile towards Martin, but he eventually warms to him.",he,"0: Paul, 1: Martin, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Paul is initially hostile towards Martin.""
2. Then it says ""but he eventually warms to him.""

The pronoun ""he"" is more likely to refer to Paul for the following reasons:
- Paul is the subject of the first clause, making him the more prominent character in the sentence.
- The sentence describes a change in Paul's attitude towards Martin, from hostility to warming up.
- It would be more natural to say that Paul (the initially hostile one) warms up to Martin, rather than Martin warming up to Paul.

Therefore, ""he"" most likely refers to Paul in this context.",0,0
1146,"Nonetheless, Harry remains with Rob until the night he learns that he had a fling with his high school nemesis, Ronnie Harrison.",he,"0: Rob, 1: Harry, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence starts with ""Nonetheless, Harry remains with Rob...""
2. Then it continues with ""...until the night he learns that he had a fling...""

The pronoun ""he"" in question is the subject of ""learns."" Given the structure of the sentence, it's more likely that Harry is the one who learns something about Rob, rather than Rob learning something about himself.

The sentence implies that Harry discovers information about Rob's past actions, which leads to a change in their relationship. It would make more sense for Harry to learn about Rob's fling with Harry's high school nemesis, as this information would be more significant and potentially relationship-altering for Harry.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Harry (candidate 1).",1,1
1147,"Denney persisted though and Wolcott was appointed, resigning his U.S. Senate seat.",his,"0: Denney, 1: Wolcott, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""his"" refers to Wolcott. The context indicates that Wolcott was appointed and subsequently resigned his U.S. Senate seat. The possessive pronoun ""his"" is directly linked to Wolcott's action of resigning the Senate seat. Denney is mentioned as persisting, but there's no indication that Denney had a Senate seat to resign.",1,1
1148,"Styles, according to Sessum, responded by threatening him with arrest if he did not tell a story consistent with Acreman's.",him,"0: Styles, 1: Sessum, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""him"" refers to Sessum. The sentence structure indicates that Styles is the subject performing the action (responding and threatening), while Sessum is the object receiving the action (being threatened). The pronoun ""him"" is used as the object of the verb ""threatening,"" which logically refers to Sessum in this context.",1,1
1149,"Danielle is eventually taken in by Tina, but she then throws her out as she continues to sponge off her.",she,"0: Danielle, 1: Tina, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. ""Danielle is eventually taken in by Tina"" - This establishes the initial situation.
2. ""but she then throws her out"" - This is the key part for determining the pronoun reference.
   - ""she"" is the subject doing the action of throwing out
   - ""her"" is the object being thrown out
3. ""as she continues to sponge off her"" - This provides additional context.

Given that Tina initially took Danielle in, it's more logical that Tina would be the one throwing Danielle out. The phrase ""continues to sponge off her"" also supports this interpretation, as it implies Danielle (the one being taken in) is taking advantage of Tina's hospitality.

Therefore, in the phrase ""but she then throws her out,"" ""she"" most likely refers to Tina.",1,1
1150,"Fontan was caught by the Spaniard Salvador Cardona, but his second place in the stage gave him the lead in the general classification.",his,"0: Fontan, 1: the Spaniard Salvador Cardona, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""his"" refers to Fontan for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure indicates that Fontan is the main subject of the action.
2. The phrase ""his second place in the stage"" is directly connected to Fontan's performance in the race.
3. The sentence concludes by mentioning that ""him"" (referring to Fontan) gained the lead in the general classification, which is logically connected to the ""second place"" mentioned earlier.

While Salvador Cardona is mentioned, he is described as catching Fontan, but the subsequent information about second place and leading the general classification clearly relates to Fontan, not Cardona.",0,0
1151,"Albert started to develop feelings for Nate, but he never managed to tell how he felt about him as he had fallen for Justin.",he,"0: Albert, 1: Nate, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. ""Albert started to develop feelings for Nate"" - This establishes Albert's initial feelings for Nate.

2. ""but he never managed to tell how he felt about him"" - Here, the first ""he"" likely refers to Albert, as he's the one who developed feelings. The ""him"" refers to Nate, the object of Albert's feelings.

3. ""as he had fallen for Justin"" - This is the key part. The ""he"" in this clause is still referring to Albert, indicating that Albert had fallen for Justin.

Given this analysis, we can conclude that the pronoun ""he"" in the question refers to Albert. Albert is the subject of the sentence and the one whose actions and feelings are being described throughout.",0,0
1152,"Simona ignores Leanne and walks out and when she comes home, she locks herself in her bedroom.",she,"0: Simona, 1: Leanne, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""she"" refers to: Simona or Leanne. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Simona ignores Leanne and walks out,"" indicating that Simona is the active subject performing the actions.
2. The sentence continues with ""and when she comes home,"" which logically follows Simona's action of walking out. It wouldn't make sense for Leanne to come home in this context, as she wasn't mentioned as leaving.
3. The final part, ""she locks herself in her bedroom,"" also aligns with Simona's actions, as she was the one who left and came back home.

Given this analysis, it's clear that both instances of ""she"" in the sentence refer to Simona, not Leanne. The pronoun ""she"" is consistently used to describe Simona's actions throughout the sentence.",0,0

1. Yuri tells Charlie something.
2. ""He"" does not believe ""him"".
3. ""He"" catches Nick with some money.

The pronoun ""he"" is more likely to refer to Charlie because:
1. Charlie is the recipient of the information from Yuri, so he would be the one to believe or not believe.
2. It makes more sense for Charlie to be the one catching Nick, as Yuri is already aware of the situation (he's the one telling Charlie).
3. The structure of the sentence suggests that ""he"" (Charlie) doesn't believe ""him"" (Yuri) until he (Charlie) catches Nick.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Charlie.",1,1
1154,"Grace attempts a reconciliation with Tiffany, but she decides she wants a divorce.",she,"0: Grace, 1: Tiffany, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Grace attempts a reconciliation with Tiffany.""
2. Then it continues with ""but she decides she wants a divorce.""

The pronoun ""she"" in this context is more likely to refer to Grace for the following reasons:
1. Grace is the subject of the first part of the sentence, making her the primary actor.
2. The sentence structure suggests a contrast between Grace's initial action (attempting reconciliation) and the subsequent decision (wanting a divorce).
3. It would be more natural for the person attempting reconciliation (Grace) to be the one who then decides on divorce, as it shows a change in her stance.

While it's not impossible for ""she"" to refer to Tiffany, it's less likely given the sentence structure and flow of information.",1,0
1155,"Emily is unable to fool the General's wife, Lady Margaret, but she is able to deceive the officers at a regimental party.",she,"0: Emily, 1: the General 's wife , Lady Margaret, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""she"" refers to: Emily or Lady Margaret. Let's analyze the context:

1. The first part of the sentence states that ""Emily is unable to fool the General's wife, Lady Margaret"".
2. The second part, connected by ""but"", says ""she is able to deceive the officers at a regimental party"".

The use of ""but"" indicates a contrast between the two parts of the sentence. Since Emily was unable to fool Lady Margaret in the first part, it logically follows that Emily is the one who is able to deceive the officers in the second part. 

Therefore, ""she"" in this context refers to Emily.",0,0
1156,"Wanda is returned to an overjoyed Ethel, although she has to pay the man in order to get her to relinquish ownership.",she,"0: Wanda, 1: an overjoyed Ethel, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Wanda is being returned to Ethel.
2. Ethel is described as ""overjoyed.""
3. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""she has to pay the man.""

Given this information, it's more likely that ""she"" refers to Ethel rather than Wanda. The reasons are:

1. Ethel is the one receiving Wanda, so she would be the one in a position to pay for Wanda's return.
2. The sentence structure suggests that Ethel is the main subject of the action (being overjoyed and having to pay).
3. It wouldn't make sense for Wanda (who is being returned) to pay for her own return.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Ethel.",1,1
1157,Janine finally agrees to have sex with Danielle but she tells her that it is a one off.,her,"0: Janine, 1: Danielle, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""her"" is used in the phrase ""she tells her"". To determine who ""her"" refers to, we need to analyze the context:

1. Janine is the subject of the first part of the sentence, agreeing to have sex with Danielle.
2. The second part of the sentence starts with ""she"", which likely refers to Janine as she is the main actor in the sentence.
3. If ""she"" refers to Janine, then ""her"" must refer to Danielle, as Janine is telling something to Danielle.

Therefore, the pronoun ""her"" in this context refers to Danielle.",1,1

1. The sentence mentions two people: Patricia and Amy.
2. The pronoun ""her"" is used in the phrase ""her fingerprints would be on the bombs.""
3. The sentence structure indicates that Patricia is the one who had Amy participate in bomb-making.
4. The purpose of this action was to ensure that someone's fingerprints would be on the bombs.
5. Logically, Patricia would want Amy's fingerprints on the bombs, not her own.

Given this analysis, it's clear that ""her"" refers to Amy. Patricia is making Amy participate in bomb-making so that Amy's fingerprints, not Patricia's, would be on the bombs.",0,0
1159,"Nell confesses that after Helen died, she tried to kill herself with a razor.",she,"0: Nell, 1: Helen, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which person the pronoun ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Nell confesses,"" indicating that Nell is the subject performing the action of confessing.
2. The pronoun ""she"" appears in the clause ""she tried to kill herself with a razor.""
3. This action of attempting suicide is described as happening ""after Helen died.""

Given this information, we can conclude that ""she"" refers to Nell for the following reasons:
- Nell is the main subject of the sentence.
- The suicide attempt is described as occurring after Helen's death, which logically means Helen cannot be the one who tried to kill herself.
- The confession is coming from Nell, implying that she is talking about her own actions.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" in this context refers to Nell.",0,0
1160,"Janine pulls Nell away, but she slips away in the confusion when the hotel detective arrives.",she,"0: Janine, 1: Nell, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, let's analyze the sentence:

""Janine pulls Nell away, but she slips away in the confusion when the hotel detective arrives.""

The pronoun ""she"" is used in the second part of the sentence, after the conjunction ""but"". This structure suggests that ""she"" refers to the person who is not the subject of the first action (pulling away).

1. Janine is the subject of the first action: ""Janine pulls Nell away""
2. The pronoun ""she"" is then used to describe someone who ""slips away""

Given this context, it's more likely that ""she"" refers to Nell, not Janine. Nell is the one being pulled away, and it makes more sense that she would be the one to slip away in the confusion.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Nell.",1,1
1161,"Julia eventually fires Evelyn, and discovers soon after that she is pregnant.",she,"0: Julia, 1: Evelyn, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence has two main parts:
   - Julia fires Evelyn
   - Julia discovers she is pregnant

2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the second part of the sentence, after the main action of firing.

3. In English, when a pronoun is used after introducing two people, it typically refers to the subject of the sentence (the person performing the action) unless explicitly stated otherwise.

4. Julia is the subject of both actions in the sentence (firing and discovering), making her the most likely referent for ""she.""

5. The pregnancy discovery is presented as new information about the subject (Julia), rather than about Evelyn who has just been fired.

Given these points, it is most logical to conclude that ""she"" refers to Julia, who is discovering her own pregnancy after firing Evelyn.",0,0
1162,Leo discovers that Apu will not have to leave if he can pass a United States citizenship test.,he,"0: Leo, 1: Apu, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Apu, not Leo. The context suggests that Apu is the one who might have to leave and who needs to pass a United States citizenship test. Leo is discovering this information about Apu's situation, so he is not the subject of the potential leaving or taking the citizenship test.",1,1
1163,DeMille later claimed that George was so difficult to work with that he eventually fired him and cancelled their contract.,he,"0: DeMille, 1: George, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence is about DeMille's actions and claims.
2. DeMille is the subject of the main clause ""DeMille later claimed...""
3. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the subordinate clause to describe actions taken against George.
4. It wouldn't make sense for George to fire himself or cancel his own contract.

Given these points, it's clear that ""he"" refers to DeMille, as he is the one who allegedly fired George and cancelled their contract.",1,0
1164,"Historians implied that the emperors were also executed, although their fate was not explicitly stated.",their,"0: Historians, 1: the emperors, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""their"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and grammatical structure of the sentence:

1. ""Historians"" is the subject of the sentence and is performing the action of implying.
2. ""The emperors"" is the object being discussed and is the subject of the implied execution.
3. The pronoun ""their"" is used in relation to the fate being discussed.

Given this analysis, ""their"" most likely refers to ""the emperors"" for the following reasons:
- The sentence is discussing the fate of the emperors, not the historians.
- It would make more sense contextually for the fate in question to belong to the emperors rather than the historians.
- The pronoun ""their"" is used in close proximity to ""the emperors"" in the sentence structure.

Therefore, the most logical referent for ""their"" is ""the emperors.""",1,1

1. Raymondo is trying to woo Edward.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""but he is still in love with Osman.""

Given this information, it's more likely that ""he"" refers to Edward rather than Raymondo. The sentence structure suggests a contrast between Raymondo's actions (trying to woo Edward) and the state of the person being wooed (still being in love with someone else). It would make more sense for Edward to be the one still in love with Osman, as this explains why Raymondo's wooing might not be successful.

If ""he"" referred to Raymondo, it would be odd for him to be trying to woo Edward while still being in love with Osman. Therefore, the most logical interpretation is that Edward is the one still in love with Osman, despite Raymondo's attempts to woo him.",1,1
1166,Hallums did not appeal to American President Bush to help earn his release.,his,"0: Hallums, 1: American President Bush, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""his"" refers to Hallums, not American President Bush. The context of the sentence suggests that Hallums is the subject who did not appeal for his own release. It wouldn't make sense for Hallums to appeal to Bush to help earn Bush's release. Therefore, ""his"" is referring to Hallums' release.",0,0
1167,"Jackie heads to the meeting to kill Shrote, but he is instead captured by his men following a shootout.",he,"0: Jackie, 1: Shrote, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, let's analyze the sentence:

1. Jackie is mentioned first, establishing him as the initial subject.
2. Shrote is mentioned second as the object of Jackie's action.
3. The pronoun ""he"" appears after Shrote is mentioned.
4. The clause ""he is instead captured by his men"" suggests that the person being captured is not the same as the one doing the capturing.

Given this information, it's most logical that ""he"" refers to Jackie because:
- Jackie is the main subject of the sentence.
- The sentence describes what happens to Jackie (he goes to kill Shrote but ends up being captured instead).
- It wouldn't make sense for Shrote to be captured by his own men in this context.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Jackie.",0,0
1168,"However, Chantelle does not believe that Emily has killed herself, so she continues searching for the real killer.",she,"0: Emily, 1: Chantelle, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" refers to Chantelle. We can determine this for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure indicates that Chantelle is the subject performing the action of ""continues searching.""
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the second part of the sentence, which is a continuation of Chantelle's actions and beliefs.
3. It would not make sense for ""she"" to refer to Emily, as Emily is the subject of Chantelle's disbelief and is implied to be dead or missing.
4. The sentence is describing Chantelle's thoughts and subsequent actions, making her the most logical antecedent for the pronoun ""she.""

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" in this context refers to Chantelle, which corresponds to candidate 1.",1,1
1169,Isabella also worried that Joanne would grow up pampered and wilful if she lacked peers and companions of her own age.,she,"0: Isabella, 1: Joanne, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" refers to Joanne. The context indicates that Isabella is worried about Joanne's upbringing, specifically that ""she"" (Joanne) would grow up pampered and wilful if she lacked peers and companions of her own age. It wouldn't make sense for Isabella to be worried about herself in this context, so the pronoun ""she"" must refer to Joanne.",1,1
1170,"After Mrs. Reed dies, Jane ponders what to do next, when she hears an anguished and beloved male voice from thin air calling her name.",she,"0: Jane, 1: Mrs. Reed, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" clearly refers to Jane. The context indicates that Jane is the main subject of the sentence, as she is the one pondering what to do next after Mrs. Reed's death. Mrs. Reed is mentioned as having died, so she cannot be the one performing the action of pondering. Additionally, the sentence describes Jane hearing a voice, which further confirms that she is the active subject of the sentence.",0,0
1171,"Mrs. LuPone was then approached to play the role of Eva's mother, but she declined.",she,"0: Eva 's mother, 1: Mrs. LuPone, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" clearly refers to Mrs. LuPone. The sentence structure indicates that Mrs. LuPone was approached to play a role, and then ""she declined."" The action of declining is attributed to the subject of the sentence, which is Mrs. LuPone. Eva's mother is mentioned only as the role that Mrs. LuPone was offered, not as an active participant in the sentence. Therefore, ""she"" must refer to Mrs. LuPone.",0,1
1172,Anna Dalassene consented to this but forced Katherine to resign immediately afterwards; she was succeeded by Eustratios Garidas.,she,"0: Katherine, 1: Anna Dalassene, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence mentions two female individuals: Anna Dalassene and Katherine.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""she was succeeded by Eustratios Garidas.""
3. The sentence structure indicates that Anna Dalassene forced Katherine to resign.
4. Logically, the person who resigns would be the one succeeded by someone else.

Based on this analysis, it's clear that Katherine is the one who resigned and was succeeded by Eustratios Garidas. Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" refers to Katherine.",0,0
1173,"At first Melissa doesn't like Abby, but in time she overcomes that and becomes friendly.",she,"0: Abby, 1: Melissa, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" refers to Melissa. The sentence structure indicates that the subject of the first clause, Melissa, is also the subject of the second clause. The pronoun ""she"" is used to continue referring to Melissa as she overcomes her initial dislike of Abby and becomes friendly. This interpretation is supported by the fact that Melissa is mentioned first in the sentence and is the one whose feelings and actions are being described throughout.",1,1
1174,"Esaias was not related to Willem van de Velde, but he was the cousin of Jan van de Velde.",he,"0: Esaias, 1: Willem van de Velde, 2: Neither","Let's analyze the sentence:
""Esaias was not related to Willem van de Velde, but he was the cousin of Jan van de Velde.""

The pronoun ""he"" in this sentence refers to Esaias for the following reasons:
1. The sentence starts by mentioning Esaias, making him the primary subject.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the second part of the sentence, which provides additional information about the subject (Esaias).
3. The sentence structure contrasts Esaias's relationship with Willem van de Velde (not related) to his relationship with Jan van de Velde (cousin), indicating that ""he"" refers to the same person throughout the sentence.
4. It wouldn't make sense for ""he"" to refer to Willem van de Velde, as the sentence explicitly states that Esaias was not related to him.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Esaias (candidate 0).",0,0
1175,Juliette attempts to stay faithful to Ramona at first when she is initially tempted.,she,"0: Ramona, 1: Juliette, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" refers to Juliette. The sentence is describing Juliette's actions and state of mind. It mentions that Juliette attempts to stay faithful to Ramona, and then it says ""when she is initially tempted."" The person being tempted in this context is clearly Juliette, as she is the one trying to remain faithful despite the temptation. Therefore, ""she"" refers to Juliette.",0,1
1176,"Naser al-Din Shah Qajar nicknamed Mohammad Hosein as the bird, after he hears a poem that he had written.",he,"0: Mohammad Hosein, 1: Naser al-Din Shah Qajar, 2: Neither","In this sentence, there are two instances of 'he'. We need to determine which 'he' the question is referring to and who that 'he' represents. The first 'he' in the sentence clearly refers to Naser al-Din Shah Qajar, as he is the subject who hears the poem. The second 'he' refers to Mohammad Hosein, as he is the one who had written the poem. Since the pronoun in question is not specified as first or second, we need to consider both. However, given that the more prominent action in the sentence is Naser al-Din Shah Qajar nicknaming Mohammad Hosein and hearing the poem, it's more likely that the 'he' in question refers to Naser al-Din Shah Qajar.",1,1
1177,"Though innocent, Jacqueline remained concerned that Annie would not return, though she eventually did and was deeply apologetic.",she,"0: Annie, 1: Jacqueline, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""she"" refers to: Annie or Jacqueline. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Though innocent, Jacqueline remained concerned..."" This indicates that Jacqueline is the main subject of the sentence.

2. The pronoun ""she"" appears in the clause ""though she eventually did and was deeply apologetic."" This refers to the person who returned and was apologetic.

3. The sentence mentions that Jacqueline was concerned that Annie would not return. This implies that Annie was the one who was away and expected to return.

4. The clause ""though she eventually did"" confirms that the person who was away did indeed return.

5. The fact that this person was ""deeply apologetic"" further supports that it was Annie who returned, as Jacqueline had no reason to apologize for being concerned.

Based on this analysis, we can conclude that ""she"" in this context refers to Annie, who returned and was apologetic for her absence.",0,0
1178,Hannah agrees that Melissa has been duly punished since she has lost her sense of sight and her husband.,she,"0: Hannah, 1: Melissa, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, let's analyze the sentence:

""Hannah agrees that Melissa has been duly punished since she has lost her sense of sight and her husband.""

The pronoun ""she"" in this sentence is most likely referring to Melissa for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure suggests that Hannah is agreeing about something that has happened to Melissa.
2. The phrase ""has been duly punished"" is directly connected to Melissa.
3. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the context of describing the punishment, which logically follows as being about Melissa.
4. The loss of sight and husband are presented as consequences or reasons for the punishment, which again relates to Melissa rather than Hannah.

Given this analysis, it's clear that ""she"" refers to Melissa in this context.",0,1
1179,Roberta does not want Chrissie to find out so she pushes Katie and murders her.,she,"0: Roberta, 1: Chrissie, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Roberta is mentioned first and is the subject of the main clause.
2. Chrissie is mentioned second as the object of Roberta's concern.
3. The pronoun ""she"" is used as the subject of the actions ""pushes"" and ""murders"".

Given that Roberta is the main subject of the sentence and the one who doesn't want Chrissie to find out something, it's most logical that ""she"" refers to Roberta. The actions of pushing Katie and murdering her are likely the things Roberta doesn't want Chrissie to discover.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Roberta.",1,0
1180,Gypsy Moth asked Mrs. Anderson if she was related to the Spider-Woman she had encountered previously; Carpenter stated that she was not.,she,"0: Mrs. Anderson, 1: Gypsy Moth, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""she"" refers to. Let's break it down:

1. Gypsy Moth asked Mrs. Anderson a question.
2. The question was about whether ""she"" was related to Spider-Woman.
3. Carpenter stated that ""she"" was not related to Spider-Woman.

The pronoun ""she"" is used twice in this context, and both times it refers to Mrs. Anderson:
1. The first ""she"" is in the question asked by Gypsy Moth to Mrs. Anderson about herself.
2. The second ""she"" is in Carpenter's response, which is answering the question about Mrs. Anderson.

Gypsy Moth is referred to by name and is the one asking the question, so ""she"" cannot refer to Gypsy Moth. Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" refers to Mrs. Anderson.",1,0
1181,"Kelly Marie decides to move in with Alexa, after she buys a new bed for Callum.",she,"0: Alexa, 1: Kelly Marie, 2: Neither","To determine who the pronoun ""she"" refers to, let's analyze the sentence:

""Kelly Marie decides to move in with Alexa, after she buys a new bed for Callum.""

The pronoun ""she"" is most likely referring to Kelly Marie for the following reasons:

1. Kelly Marie is the subject of the main clause and the first person mentioned in the sentence, making her the most prominent character.
2. The action of buying a new bed for Callum seems to be connected to Kelly Marie's decision to move in with Alexa. It's more logical that Kelly Marie would buy a new bed before moving in, rather than Alexa buying a bed for someone else when Kelly Marie is the one moving.
3. The sentence structure suggests that ""she"" refers to the subject of the main clause (Kelly Marie), as it's describing an action taken by Kelly Marie before moving in.

While it's not impossible for ""she"" to refer to Alexa, it's less likely given the context and sentence structure.",0,1
1182,The Punishers interrogates prisoners and when finished they execute them via an electric chair-like molecular disintegrator.,they,"0: prisoners, 1: The Punishers, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, let's analyze the sentence:

""The Punishers interrogates prisoners and when finished they execute them via an electric chair-like molecular disintegrator.""

The pronoun ""they"" is used as the subject of the verb ""execute."" In this context, it's clear that the ones doing the executing are The Punishers, not the prisoners. The sentence structure indicates that The Punishers are performing both actions: interrogating and executing.

The prisoners are the objects of these actions (being interrogated and executed), so they cannot be the subject ""they"" in this sentence.

Therefore, the pronoun ""they"" refers to The Punishers.",1,1
1183,Tricia then asks Julia if she has experienced any return of the night terrors.,she,"0: Julia, 1: Tricia, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Julia. The context suggests that Tricia is asking Julia about her experience with night terrors. It would be more natural for Tricia to inquire about Julia's condition rather than her own. The structure of the sentence, ""Tricia then asks Julia if she has experienced..."" implies that ""she"" refers to Julia, the person being asked about the night terrors.",0,0
1184,"Katie threatens Daniele, telling her she will be put into care if she says anything.",her,"0: Katie, 1: Daniele, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""her"" the pronoun refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Katie is the subject of the sentence, performing the action of threatening.
2. Daniele is the object of the sentence, receiving the threat.
3. The pronoun ""her"" appears twice in the sentence.

For the first ""her"" in ""telling her,"" it refers to Daniele because Katie is telling something to Daniele.

For the second ""her"" in ""if she says anything,"" it also refers to Daniele because the threat is about Daniele potentially saying something.

Both instances of ""her"" in this sentence refer to Daniele, not Katie. Therefore, the correct answer is 1, which corresponds to Daniele.",1,1
1185,"Roberta angrily pushes Katie but the floor collapses and she falls into the basement, breaking her neck.",she,"0: Roberta, 1: Katie, 2: Neither","To determine who ""she"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and the sequence of events:

1. Roberta pushes Katie angrily.
2. The floor collapses.
3. ""She"" falls into the basement.
4. ""She"" breaks her neck.

The pronoun ""she"" is more likely to refer to Katie for the following reasons:
1. Katie is the recipient of the push, which puts her in a more vulnerable position.
2. The sentence structure suggests that the falling is a consequence of the push, making Katie the more logical subject of the fall.
3. Breaking one's neck is more likely to happen to the person being pushed rather than the person doing the pushing.

While it's not impossible for Roberta to have fallen, the context strongly suggests that Katie is the one who fell and broke her neck as a result of being pushed.",1,1
1186,"Also, Chrissie breaks up with Roberta, after finding out about her role in the robbery from Adam's half-brother Ross.",her,"0: Roberta, 1: Chrissie, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""her"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence states that ""Chrissie breaks up with Roberta.""
2. The reason for the breakup is ""after finding out about her role in the robbery.""
3. The pronoun ""her"" is used in reference to the person who had a role in the robbery.
4. Since Chrissie is breaking up with Roberta due to this information, it logically follows that ""her"" refers to Roberta's role in the robbery.

Therefore, the pronoun ""her"" most likely refers to Roberta (candidate 0).",0,0
1187,Harry is still in love with Mark but he hides his feelings behind a rich playboy exterior.,he,"0: Harry, 1: Mark, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Harry for the following reasons:

1. Harry is the subject of the first clause and is mentioned first in the sentence, making him the more prominent character.
2. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" is performing an action (hiding feelings) that is directly related to Harry's emotional state (being in love with Mark).
3. It would be less logical for Mark to be hiding his feelings behind a rich playboy exterior in this context, as the sentence is primarily about Harry's emotions and actions.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Harry (candidate 0).",0,0
1188,"Micheal argued with the foreman, but he insisted that it was against the religious convictions of the cemetery to bury mutants.",he,"0: Micheal, 1: the foreman, 2: Neither","To determine who ""he"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and the logical flow of the sentence.

1. The sentence starts with ""Micheal argued with the foreman.""
2. Then it says ""but he insisted...""

The use of ""but"" suggests a contrast or opposition to the previous action (arguing). This implies that ""he"" is likely referring to the person who was not doing the arguing, which would be the foreman.

Furthermore, the insistence about the cemetery's religious convictions against burying mutants seems more likely to come from the foreman, who would be in a position of authority at the cemetery, rather than Micheal, who appears to be the one arguing against this stance.

Therefore, based on the context and the logical flow of the sentence, ""he"" most likely refers to the foreman.",1,1
1189,Miranda goes to see how Felicia is doing and she asks if she knows where she might be able to find Zach.,she,"0: Miranda, 1: Felicia, 2: Neither","In this sentence, there are multiple instances of the pronoun ""she"". We need to determine which ""she"" refers to Miranda or Felicia, or if it's ambiguous.

Let's break down the sentence:
1. Miranda goes to see how Felicia is doing
2. she asks if she knows where she might be able to find Zach

The first ""she"" in the second part of the sentence is likely referring to Miranda, as she is the one who went to see Felicia. It would make more sense for Miranda to be asking Felicia a question, rather than Felicia asking herself.

The second and third ""she"" in the sentence are more ambiguous and could refer to either Miranda or Felicia. However, since we're asked to determine which candidate the pronoun refers to, and the first clear use of ""she"" refers to Miranda, we should choose Miranda as the answer.",1,0
1190,"The policeman asks Akakiy embarrassing questions, as if he were a criminal.",he,"0: The policeman, 1: Akakiy, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Akakiy, not the policeman. The context suggests that Akakiy is being questioned by the policeman as if Akakiy were a criminal. The pronoun ""he"" in the phrase ""as if he were a criminal"" is describing the person being questioned (Akakiy) rather than the one asking the questions (the policeman).",0,1
1191,"Chvez's forces, however, had failed to take the outlaws since they remained inside the Military Museum.",they,"0: the outlaws, 1: Chvez 's forces, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" refers to ""the outlaws"" for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""they"" is the subject of the clause ""remained inside the Military Museum.""

2. Logically, it makes more sense for the outlaws to be the ones remaining inside the Military Museum, as Chávez's forces are trying to take them.

3. The phrase ""had failed to take the outlaws"" implies that the outlaws are the ones being pursued or targeted, and thus they would be the ones remaining inside the museum.

4. It would be redundant and illogical for ""they"" to refer to ""Chávez's forces"" in this context, as the forces are already mentioned as the subject of the first part of the sentence.

Therefore, the pronoun ""they"" most likely refers to ""the outlaws"" in this sentence.",1,0
1192,"Henry Algernon Percy was well looked after and brought up at the court of King Henry VII, while his sisters' marriages were the object of careful negotiation.",his,"0: King Henry VII, 1: Henry Algernon Percy, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""his"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence. The pronoun ""his"" is used in the phrase ""his sisters' marriages,"" which implies that we are talking about someone who has sisters.

In this sentence, we have two named individuals:
1. Henry Algernon Percy
2. King Henry VII

The sentence structure suggests that Henry Algernon Percy is the main subject of the sentence. It states that he ""was well looked after and brought up at the court of King Henry VII."" This indicates that Henry Algernon Percy is the primary person being discussed.

Furthermore, the use of ""his sisters' marriages"" directly follows the information about Henry Algernon Percy. It would be more logical for the sisters to belong to Henry Algernon Percy rather than King Henry VII, as the sentence is primarily about Percy's upbringing and family arrangements.

Therefore, the pronoun ""his"" most likely refers to Henry Algernon Percy.",1,1
1193,Bambi gets into another fight with Ronno when he sees him bothering Faline.,he,"0: Bambi, 1: Ronno, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Bambi gets into another fight with Ronno.""
2. The pronoun ""he"" appears in the clause ""when he sees him bothering Faline.""
3. The pronoun ""he"" is the subject of the verb ""sees.""
4. The pronoun ""him"" refers to the object being seen, which is likely Ronno bothering Faline.

Given this analysis, it's most logical that ""he"" refers to Bambi for the following reasons:
- Bambi is the main subject of the sentence.
- The action of seeing Ronno bothering Faline is what triggers Bambi to get into a fight with Ronno.
- It wouldn't make sense for Ronno to see himself bothering Faline.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Bambi.",1,0
1194,"Adam briefly seized Dulo, though the Mandara counterattack soon drove him from the kingdom's borders.",him,"0: Adam, 1: Dulo, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""him"" refers to Adam. The sentence structure indicates that Adam is the subject who initially seized Dulo, and then the Mandara counterattack drove ""him"" (Adam) from the kingdom's borders. The pronoun ""him"" is used to avoid repeating Adam's name in the second part of the sentence. It wouldn't make sense for ""him"" to refer to Dulo in this context, as Dulo is the object being seized, not the one being driven from the borders.",1,0
1195,"Abdul Hamid was called Lahori because he was from Lahore, Punjab in modern Pakistan.",he,"0: Lahori, 1: Abdul Hamid, 2: Neither","The pronoun ""he"" in this sentence clearly refers to Abdul Hamid. The sentence is explaining why Abdul Hamid was called Lahori, stating that it was because he (Abdul Hamid) was from Lahore. The pronoun ""he"" is used to avoid repeating Abdul Hamid's name and directly refers back to him as the subject of the sentence.",1,1
1196,"Ann goes to the cellar looking for Belle, but Freudstein decapitates her after slashing her throat.",her,"0: Ann, 1: Belle, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""her"" refers to: Ann or Belle. Let's analyze the context:

1. Ann is the subject of the sentence, actively going to the cellar.
2. Belle is mentioned as the person Ann is looking for.
3. The pronoun ""her"" is used twice in the latter part of the sentence: ""decapitates her"" and ""slashing her throat.""

Given the structure of the sentence, it's more likely that ""her"" refers to Ann for the following reasons:
- Ann is the main actor in the sentence, making her the more prominent subject.
- The action of decapitation and throat slashing is described immediately after mentioning Ann's action, suggesting a continuation of events involving Ann.
- If it were Belle being attacked, the sentence structure would likely be different, possibly mentioning that Freudstein attacked Belle when Ann found her.

Therefore, the pronoun ""her"" most likely refers to Ann in this context.",0,0
1197,Zifnab senses that Haplo is very important even though he is a Patryn.,he,"0: Haplo, 1: Zifnab, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Haplo. The sentence structure suggests that Zifnab is the subject who is sensing something about Haplo. The clause ""even though he is a Patryn"" provides additional information about Haplo, using ""he"" to refer back to him. It wouldn't make sense for ""he"" to refer to Zifnab in this context, as the sentence is describing Zifnab's perception of Haplo, not Zifnab himself.",0,0
1198,"Damien also seems to have a crush on Nathan, but he fails to talk to him.",he,"0: Damien, 1: Nathan, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""he"" refers to: Damien or Nathan. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Damien also seems to have a crush on Nathan""
2. Then it continues with ""but he fails to talk to him""

The pronoun ""he"" in this case is more likely to refer to Damien because:
1. Damien is the subject of the first part of the sentence
2. The sentence is describing Damien's actions and feelings
3. It would make more sense for Damien (who has the crush) to fail to talk to Nathan (the object of his crush) rather than the other way around

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" in this context most likely refers to Damien.",0,0
1199,"Mrs. Khan tried to take possession of Baz Bahadur's Hindu mistress Rani Roopmati also, but she killed herself by consuming poison.",she,"0: Baz Bahadur 's Hindu mistress Rani Roopmati, 1: Mrs. Khan, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and grammatical structure of the sentence:

1. The sentence mentions two female individuals: Mrs. Khan and Rani Roopmati.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the latter part of the sentence, referring to the subject of the action ""killed herself.""
3. The sentence structure indicates that Mrs. Khan is trying to take possession of Rani Roopmati.
4. The use of ""but"" suggests a contrast between Mrs. Khan's action and the subsequent event.
5. Logically, it would make sense that Rani Roopmati, being the object of possession, would be the one to take such a drastic action to avoid being possessed.

Given these points, it is most likely that ""she"" refers to Rani Roopmati, who is the first candidate in the list.",0,0
1200,"Kate tries to talk to Janet, but she fails to succeed.",she,"0: Kate, 1: Janet, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Kate is the subject of the sentence and is trying to talk to Janet.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""she fails to succeed.""
3. The action of failing to succeed is logically connected to the attempt to talk.

Given this information, it's most likely that ""she"" refers to Kate. Kate is the one trying to talk, so she would be the one failing to succeed in this action. Janet is the object of Kate's attempt to talk, not the one performing the action.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Kate.",1,0
1201,"Stuart was banned from bowling for the remainder of the innings by umpire John Hampshire after delivering two high, fast full-tosses in his first three balls.",his,"0: Stuart, 1: umpire John Hampshire, 2: Neither","The pronoun ""his"" in this context refers to Stuart, not umpire John Hampshire. The sentence is describing Stuart's actions during a bowling innings. It mentions that Stuart was banned from bowling after delivering two high, fast full-tosses in ""his first three balls.""

The sentence is describing Ma's emotional state (being fearful) according to the director's perspective. It wouldn't make sense for the fear to belong to the director in this context. The sentence is clearly about Ma's fear and his lack of understanding about its origins.",0,1
1203,"Evans was influenced by the works of Karl Rensch, but he was not comfortable with the ideas of phylogenetic classification.",he,"0: Evans, 1: Karl Rensch, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Evans for the following reasons:

1. Evans is the main subject of the sentence and is mentioned first.
2. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" is referring back to Evans, as it's describing Evans' reaction to Karl Rensch's ideas.
3. The phrase ""but he was not comfortable"" is contrasting with the first part of the sentence about Evans being influenced, indicating that ""he"" is the same person as Evans.

Karl Rensch is mentioned only as a reference point for Evans' influences, not as the main subject of the sentence. Therefore, ""he"" is most likely referring to Evans.",0,0
1204,"Steve fires Stavi, but he hires him to work around his apartment.",him,"0: Steve, 1: Stavi, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. ""Steve fires Stavi"" - This establishes that Steve is in a position of authority over Stavi.
2. ""but he hires him"" - Here, ""he"" refers to Steve (the one who fired), and ""him"" refers to Stavi (the one who was fired).
3. ""to work around his apartment"" - This further confirms that Steve is the one doing the hiring, as it's his apartment.

The pronoun ""him"" in this context refers to Stavi because:
- Steve is the subject performing the action (hiring).
- ""him"" is the object receiving the action (being hired).
- It wouldn't make sense for Steve to hire himself to work around his own apartment.

Therefore, the pronoun ""him"" clearly refers to Stavi.",0,1
1205,"Carlos becomes obsessed with Simon, but he suffers feelings of guilt since he is Rose's fianc.",he,"0: Carlos, 1: Simon, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Carlos becomes obsessed with Simon""
2. Then it continues with ""but he suffers feelings of guilt""
3. The reason for the guilt is given: ""since he is Rose's fianc""

The pronoun ""he"" is used twice in this sentence. Let's break it down:

1. The first ""he"" in ""but he suffers feelings of guilt"" is more likely to refer to Carlos because:
   a) Carlos is the subject of the first clause
   b) It makes more sense for Carlos to feel guilty about his obsession with Simon

2. The second ""he"" in ""since he is Rose's fianc"" also refers to Carlos because:
   a) It's a continuation of the same thought
   b) Being Rose's fiancé explains why Carlos would feel guilty about his obsession with Simon

Therefore, both instances of ""he"" in this sentence refer to Carlos.",1,"0

1206,"Lucy is proved right and Paula is disappointed, so she takes her to Ramsay Street and gets him to open up to her.",she,"0: Lucy, 1: Paula, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and the actions described in the sentence.

1. The sentence starts with ""Lucy is proved right and Paula is disappointed"".
2. Then it says ""so she takes her to Ramsay Street"".
3. The use of ""so"" indicates that the action of taking someone to Ramsay Street is a result of the previous statement.
4. It's more logical that the person who is disappointed (Paula) would take action as a result of that disappointment, rather than the person who is proved right (Lucy).
5. Therefore, ""she"" in this context most likely refers to Paula, who is taking Lucy (referred to as ""her"") to Ramsay Street.

The pronoun ""she"" in this sentence is referring to Paula, who is taking action as a result of her disappointment.",0,1
1207,"Julian was disgusted with Les when he drank the money he'd saved for their electricity bill, and the power was cut off.",he,"0: Julian, 1: Les, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. Julian is described as being ""disgusted with Les.""
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""when he drank the money.""
3. The action of drinking the money (likely meaning spending it on alcohol) is the cause of Julian's disgust.
4. This action led to the electricity bill not being paid and the power being cut off.

Based on this analysis, it's clear that ""he"" refers to Les, not Julian. Julian is the one who is disgusted, while Les is the one who performed the action that caused the disgust and the subsequent consequences.",1,1
1208,Shan is apparently killed after being strangled by the possessed Pinky but his lucky charm saves him.,his,"0: Shan, 1: the possessed Pinky, 2: Neither","The pronoun ""his"" in this sentence refers to Shan for the following reasons:

1. Shan is the main subject of the sentence and the one who is apparently killed.
2. The lucky charm is mentioned as saving ""him,"" which logically refers to the person who was in danger (Shan).
3. It's more likely for Shan to have a lucky charm that saves him, rather than the possessed Pinky having a lucky charm that saves Shan.
4. Grammatically, ""his"" is more likely to refer to the subject of the sentence (Shan) rather than the object (Pinky).

Therefore, ""his"" most likely refers to Shan's lucky charm.",0,0
1209,"Cancellara then rode in support of team leader Christina until the seventeenth stage, where she abandoned the race in order to focus on the World Championships.",she,"0: Cancellara, 1: team leader Christina, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to ""team leader Christina"" for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure suggests that Cancellara (likely a male cyclist based on the name) was supporting Christina, who is explicitly referred to as the team leader.

2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the context of abandoning the race, which is more likely to refer to the team leader (Christina) than to Cancellara, who was described as riding in support.

3. The use of ""she"" grammatically aligns with Christina, who is explicitly identified as female (team leader Christina).

4. It would be unusual for the sentence to switch subjects from Christina back to Cancellara without explicitly mentioning Cancellara again.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to team leader Christina.",1,1
1210,"The senate members refused to call the Board of Trustees to meet because they knew they would admit new traditionalist, members and obtain control of the congregation.",they,"0: the Board of Trustees, 1: The senate members, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""The senate members refused to call the Board of Trustees to meet...""
2. The pronoun ""they"" appears twice in the latter part of the sentence: ""...because they knew they would admit new traditionalist members...""
3. Logically, the group that ""knew"" and ""would admit new traditionalist members"" is more likely to be the Board of Trustees, not the senate members.
4. The senate members are refusing to call the Board of Trustees because of what the Board would do (admit new members and gain control).
5. Therefore, ""they"" in this context refers to the Board of Trustees, not the senate members.

Based on this reasoning, the pronoun ""they"" refers to the Board of Trustees.",1,0
1211,"Fearnley was asked by Moss if he wanted to become a permanent member of a band in which he sometimes played, Culture Club.",he,"0: Fearnley, 1: Moss, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Fearnley.

1212,"Tanya was initially immune to Phoebe's powers, because her bestial nature was so near the surface.",her,"0: Tanya, 1: Phoebe, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""her"" is used to refer to Tanya. The sentence is describing Tanya's immunity to Phoebe's powers, and the phrase ""her bestial nature"" is describing a characteristic of Tanya, not Phoebe. The sentence structure indicates that Tanya is the subject who possesses this bestial nature, which is the reason for her immunity to Phoebe's powers.",0,0
1213,"Because the BFG refuses to eat the human, he subsists on a revolting vegetable known as a ` Snozzcumber'.",he,"0: the BFG, 1: the human, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" clearly refers to the BFG (Big Friendly Giant). The sentence is describing the BFG's eating habits, stating that because he refuses to eat humans, he instead eats a vegetable called a 'Snozzcumber'. The pronoun ""he"" is used to continue referring to the BFG from the beginning of the sentence. The human is only mentioned as something the BFG refuses to eat, not as the subject of the sentence or the one doing the eating.",0,0
1214,"Kate loved Ravonna, but she hated her due to his attempt to conquer the kingdom.",she,"0: Kate, 1: Ravonna, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. ""Kate loved Ravonna"" - This establishes the two main characters in the sentence.
2. ""but she hated her"" - Here we have two pronouns: ""she"" and ""her"".
3. ""due to his attempt to conquer the kingdom"" - This introduces a new male character (""his"") who is not one of the given candidates.

The pronoun we're asked about is ""she"". In this context, ""she"" is the subject who is doing the hating. Given the structure of the sentence, it's most logical that ""she"" refers to Kate, because:

1. Kate is mentioned first in the sentence, making her the primary subject.
2. The sentence structure suggests a contrast (""but"") between Kate's initial feeling (love) and the subsequent feeling (hate).
3. It wouldn't make sense for Ravonna to hate herself.

Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Kate.",1,0
1215,"Hunters were sent in to kill the tigers, but they managed to evade them.",they,"0: Hunters, 1: the tigers, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and meaning of the sentence:

1. The sentence starts with ""Hunters were sent in to kill the tigers.""
2. The second part of the sentence says ""but they managed to evade them.""

The key point here is the use of ""evade."" Logically, it makes more sense that the tigers would be evading the hunters, not the other way around. Hunters are typically the pursuers, while the tigers would be trying to avoid being killed.

Therefore, ""they"" in this context most likely refers to ""the tigers"" because:
a) The tigers would be the ones trying to evade the hunters.
b) It wouldn't make sense for the hunters to evade themselves or something not mentioned.",1,1

The first 'she' clearly refers to Hana, as it states 'she can't tell her'. This implies that Hana is the one who can't tell Sissi about her feelings. The second 'she' also refers to Hana, as it continues to describe Hana's crushes on various people. Therefore, the pronoun 'she' in this context refers to Hana.",0,0
1217,Penelope claims to suspect Ruth because she suspected Ms Lingard would rescue her daughter and confess.,she,"0: Penelope, 1: Ruth, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence starts with ""Penelope claims to suspect Ruth...""
2. The pronoun ""she"" appears in the clause ""...because she suspected Ms Lingard would rescue her daughter and confess.""

Given this context, it's more logical that ""she"" refers to Penelope rather than Ruth for the following reasons:

1. Penelope is the subject of the main clause and is performing the action of suspecting Ruth.
2. The ""because"" clause provides a reason for Penelope's suspicion, which is more likely to be Penelope's own thought process rather than Ruth's.
3. It wouldn't make sense for Ruth to suspect that Ms Lingard would rescue her own (Ruth's) daughter, as this information seems to be part of the reason for Penelope's suspicion.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Penelope (candidate 0).",0,0
1218,Patrick tries to tell Daniel but he suffers a stroke before he can.,he,"0: Patrick, 1: Daniel, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""he"" refers to - Patrick or Daniel. Let's analyze the context:

1. Patrick is trying to tell Daniel something.
2. ""He"" suffers a stroke before he can tell.

The pronoun ""he"" is more likely to refer to Patrick because:
- Patrick is the subject of the sentence and the one performing the action (trying to tell).
- The stroke prevents the telling from happening, which aligns with Patrick's action being interrupted.
- It would be less logical for Daniel to suffer a stroke in this context, as he is the recipient of the intended information, not the one trying to communicate.

Therefore, ""he"" most likely refers to Patrick.",0,0
1219,Becca is further upset by Freya after the wedding when she tells her she and Stacey are planning to live together and that she should get a boyfriend.,she,"0: Becca, 1: Freya, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence. 

The sentence structure suggests that ""she"" is the subject who is telling something to someone else. In this case, ""she"" is telling Becca about plans to live with Stacey and suggesting that Becca should get a boyfriend.

Given this context, it's clear that ""she"" refers to Freya, not Becca. Freya is the one informing Becca about her plans with Stacey and giving advice to Becca.

Additionally, the sentence starts with ""Becca is further upset by Freya,"" which sets up Freya as the active party in the interaction, further supporting that ""she"" refers to Freya.",1,1
1220,"Although elderly, Morda is stronger than Taran, but his strength finally snaps the bone in desperate fury to regain it.",his,"0: Taran, 1: Morda, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""his"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and grammatical structure of the sentence.

1. The sentence starts by describing Morda as elderly but stronger than Taran.
2. The pronoun ""his"" is used in the latter part of the sentence, referring to someone's strength.
3. The phrase ""his strength finally snaps the bone"" implies that the person being referred to is exerting a great deal of force.
4. Given that Morda is described as stronger than Taran, it's more likely that Morda would be capable of such a forceful action.
5. The sentence also mentions ""desperate fury to regain it,"" which suggests that the person is trying to regain something they've lost or are losing. This aligns more with the idea of an elderly person (Morda) trying to maintain their strength rather than the younger Taran.

Based on these observations, it's most logical to conclude that ""his"" refers to Morda.",0,1
1221,"Dubuche is not half as bold as Claude and, although a painter, finds music to be his passion.",his,"0: Dubuche, 1: Claude, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""his"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions two people: Dubuche and Claude.
2. The pronoun ""his"" is used in the phrase ""finds music to be his passion.""
3. This phrase is directly connected to the subject of the second part of the sentence, which is Dubuche.
4. The sentence structure suggests that Dubuche is the one who finds music to be his passion, not Claude.

Therefore, the pronoun ""his"" most likely refers to Dubuche.",1,0
1222,"The Norwegians begged the kings to refuse, but they would not break their word and gave orders to proceed.",they,"0: the kings, 1: The Norwegians, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" refers to ""the kings"" for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure indicates that ""they"" is the subject of the second part of the sentence, which is contrasting with the first part.

2. The actions described after ""they"" (not breaking their word and giving orders to proceed) are more likely to be associated with kings, who have the authority to make such decisions.

3. The Norwegians are described as ""begging"" the kings, which puts them in a position of requesting something from the kings. The kings are then the ones who make the decision, which is referred to by ""they.""

4. Grammatically, ""they"" is plural, which matches with ""the kings"" (plural) rather than ""The Norwegians"" (also plural, but less likely given the context).

Therefore, the pronoun ""they"" most likely refers to ""the kings"" in this sentence.",0,0
1223,"Madeline is very nervous about Ellen, since her father-in-law had lucrative business dealings with the Germans and has been arrested as a collaborator.",her,"0: Madeline, 1: Ellen, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""her"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence is about Madeline being nervous about Ellen.
2. The pronoun ""her"" is used in relation to a father-in-law.
3. The father-in-law had business dealings with the Germans and was arrested as a collaborator.

Given this information, it's more likely that ""her"" refers to Ellen rather than Madeline. The reason is:

- The sentence structure suggests that Madeline is nervous about Ellen because of something related to Ellen's family.
- The mention of a ""father-in-law"" implies a connection to Ellen, as it's more natural to mention Ellen's father-in-law in this context rather than Madeline's.
- The fact that this father-in-law had business dealings with Germans and was arrested as a collaborator explains why Madeline would be nervous about Ellen.

Therefore, the pronoun ""her"" most likely refers to Ellen.",1,1
1224,"Ayesha Takia was offered the role of Nikki, but she refused because of the intimate scenes.",she,"0: Nikki, 1: Ayesha Takia, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" clearly refers to Ayesha Takia. The sentence structure indicates that Ayesha Takia was offered a role, which she then refused. The pronoun ""she"" is used to avoid repeating Ayesha Takia's name in the second part of the sentence. Nikki is mentioned as the name of the role, not as a person making a decision, so the pronoun cannot refer to Nikki.",1,1
1225,"Will Alvin allow Evin to join, or will he let his male ego get the better of him?",he,"0: Alvin, 1: Evin, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Alvin for the following reasons:

1. Alvin is mentioned first in the sentence, making him the primary subject.
2. The sentence structure suggests that Alvin is the one making the decision about allowing Evin to join.
3. The phrase ""his male ego"" is more likely to refer to the person in the position of power or decision-making, which in this case is Alvin.
4. It wouldn't make sense for ""he"" to refer to Evin in this context, as Evin is the one potentially being allowed to join, not the one making the decision.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Alvin.",0,0
1226,Chloe is nanny to Jane but she neglects her so she and Syd can have sex.,her,"0: Chloe, 1: Jane, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""her"" most likely refers to Jane. The context suggests that Chloe is the nanny to Jane, and the pronoun ""her"" is used in the phrase ""she neglects her."" It would make more sense for the nanny (Chloe) to be neglecting the child she's supposed to be caring for (Jane) rather than neglecting herself. Additionally, the sentence implies that Chloe is neglecting her duties to engage in activities with Syd, further supporting the interpretation that ""her"" refers to Jane, the one being neglected.",0,1
1227,Mark tries to cheer Bart up but he ended up calling Los Angeles.,he,"0: Mark, 1: Bart, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Mark. The sentence structure suggests that Mark is the subject who is performing the action of trying to cheer Bart up. The pronoun ""he"" is then used to continue describing Mark's actions, indicating that Mark ended up calling Los Angeles. This interpretation makes the most logical sense in the context of the sentence.",1,0
1228,Delilah proposes twice to Katie but she turns her down on both occasions.,she,"0: Delilah, 1: Katie, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Delilah is the subject of the sentence and is performing the action of proposing.
2. Katie is the recipient of the proposals.
3. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""she turns her down on both occasions.""

Given this information, we can deduce that ""she"" refers to Katie because:
- Katie is the logical subject of the action ""turns her down.""
- ""Her"" in this context refers to Delilah, as Katie is turning down Delilah's proposals.
- It wouldn't make sense for Delilah to turn herself down after proposing.

Therefore, ""she"" in this sentence refers to Katie.",1,1
1229,Kara is in love with Tanya but she is too shy to tell her.,her,"0: Kara, 1: Tanya, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""her"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Kara is the subject of the sentence.
2. Tanya is the object of Kara's affection.
3. The pronoun ""she"" in the second part of the sentence refers to Kara, as Kara is the one who is shy.
4. The pronoun ""her"" at the end of the sentence is the object of ""tell.""

Given this analysis, ""her"" most likely refers to Tanya. Kara is too shy to tell Tanya about her feelings. It wouldn't make sense for Kara to be too shy to tell herself, so ""her"" must refer to Tanya.",1,1
1230,"Ida becomes jealous and attempts to drown Tamarah, but Vincent arrives to stop her.",her,"0: Ida, 1: Tamarah, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""her"" the pronoun refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Ida is the subject of the sentence and is performing the action of attempting to drown someone.
2. Tamarah is the object of the drowning attempt.
3. Vincent arrives to stop ""her"".

Given this information, it's most logical that Vincent is trying to stop Ida from drowning Tamarah. The pronoun ""her"" in this context refers to Ida, as she is the one performing the action that needs to be stopped.

Therefore, the pronoun ""her"" refers to Ida.",0,0
1231,"Ida becomes jealous and attempts to drown Tamarah, but Vincent arrives to save her.",her,"0: Ida, 1: Tamarah, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""her"" most likely refers to Tamarah for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure indicates that Vincent arrives to save someone.
2. Logically, Vincent would be saving the person who is being drowned, not the person doing the drowning.
3. Ida is the subject of the sentence, performing the action of attempting to drown Tamarah.
4. Tamarah is the object of the drowning attempt, and therefore the person in need of saving.

The pronoun ""her"" in ""to save her"" refers to the person being saved, which is Tamarah.",0,1

1. The sentence structure indicates that ""Both Muranians and Professor Beetson"" are the subjects who want to get rid of someone else.

2. The clause ""so they lose their radio contract"" logically follows as a consequence of the action taken by the Muranians and Professor Beetson.

3. It makes more sense in context that the performers would be the ones losing their radio contract, not the Muranians and Professor Beetson.

4. The final part of the sentence, ""and Radio Ranch is vacated,"" further supports this interpretation, as it's likely that the performers leaving (due to losing their contract) would result in the Radio Ranch being vacated.

Therefore, ""they"" in this context refers to ""the performers"" (option 0).",1,0
1233,"Arnold is forced to write to John and when he reads the letter, it triggers the bad blood that he inherited from his mother.",he,"0: Arnold, 1: John, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Arnold is forced to write to John""
2. Then it continues with ""and when he reads the letter""
3. The pronoun ""he"" is more likely to refer to the person receiving the letter, not the one writing it
4. John is the recipient of the letter that Arnold writes
5. The latter part of the sentence, ""it triggers the bad blood that he inherited from his mother,"" makes more sense if it's referring to John reading the letter and having an emotional reaction

Based on this analysis, it's more logical that ""he"" refers to John, who is reading the letter that Arnold wrote.",1,1
1234,Mellish disliked Callaghan so much that he resigned from the cabinet within months of Wilson's own retirement.,he,"0: Mellish, 1: Callaghan, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions two people: Mellish and Callaghan.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""he resigned from the cabinet.""
3. The sentence structure indicates that the subject of the main clause (Mellish) is also the subject of the subordinate clause (he resigned).
4. The sentence is about Mellish's actions and feelings towards Callaghan.
5. It would not make sense for Callaghan to resign due to Mellish's dislike of him.

Based on these points, it is clear that ""he"" refers to Mellish, as Mellish is the one who resigned from the cabinet due to his dislike of Callaghan.",1,0
1235,George is not fond of Zach but he can not say why because of his aphasia.,his,"0: George, 1: Zach, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""his"" refers to when it says ""his aphasia."" Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence starts with ""George is not fond of Zach.""
2. Then it says ""but he can not say why.""
3. Finally, it mentions ""because of his aphasia.""

The pronoun ""he"" in the middle of the sentence most likely refers to George, as he is the subject of the sentence and the one who is not fond of Zach. It follows that ""his aphasia"" is also referring to George, as it's explaining why he can't say why he's not fond of Zach.

Aphasia is a language disorder that affects a person's ability to communicate, which aligns with the inability to explain his feelings. It makes more sense for this condition to be attributed to George in this context, as he's the one unable to express his reasons for not liking Zach.

Therefore, ""his"" in ""his aphasia"" most likely refers to George.",0,"0

The sentence structure indicates that Kutuzov is the subject who could have taken an action (attacking Krasny) but chose not to. The pronoun ""he"" is used to avoid repeating Kutuzov's name in the second part of the sentence. Krasny is mentioned as the object of the potential attack, not the subject making a choice.

The sentence states that Li Bai was searching for Xu Xuanping but couldn't find ""him"".

1. The sentence starts with ""Napoleon wanted to regain the colony of Frederick II.""
2. The second part of the sentence uses ""he"" and ""his"": ""but he preferred to save his main French army...""

The pronoun ""his"" is used in reference to the main French army. Since Napoleon is the subject of the sentence and the one making decisions about the French army, it is most logical that ""his"" refers to Napoleon.

Frederick II is mentioned only in passing as the owner of the colony Napoleon wanted to regain. It wouldn't make sense for ""his main French army"" to refer to Frederick II, as Frederick II was not French (he was Prussian).

Therefore, the pronoun ""his"" most likely refers to Napoleon.",0,0
1239,"However, Belle still wants Rania so she convinces Cassie to tutor Drew Curtis, while she unsuccessfully attempted to steal Ric back.",she,"0: Rania, 1: Belle, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence starts with ""However, Belle still wants Rania...""
2. Then it continues with ""so she convinces Cassie to tutor Drew Curtis...""
3. The action of convincing Cassie is more likely to be performed by Belle, who is the main subject of the sentence.
4. The sentence structure suggests that ""she"" refers to the person who wants something (Belle wants Rania) and then takes action based on that desire.
5. The latter part of the sentence, ""while she unsuccessfully attempted to steal Ric back,"" also aligns with Belle's actions, as she is trying to manipulate the situation.

Given this analysis, it's clear that ""she"" refers to Belle in both instances in the sentence. Rania is mentioned as the object of Belle's desire, not as the subject performing actions.",1,1
1240,Cassie becomes close with Alexa but she is shocked when she discovers that she is dealing drugs.,she,"0: Cassie, 1: Alexa, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. The pronoun ""she"" appears three times in the sentence.
2. The first ""she"" likely refers to Cassie, as she is the subject of the sentence and the one experiencing the shock.
3. The second ""she"" also likely refers to Cassie, continuing from the first instance.
4. The third ""she"" is the one who is dealing drugs, which is the shocking discovery.
5. Given that Cassie is shocked by this discovery, it's more likely that Alexa is the one dealing drugs.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" in the context of ""she is dealing drugs"" most likely refers to Alexa.",0,1
1241,"After hearing all this Mimi leaves Layla, so that she could have some space and collect her thoughts.",she,"0: Mimi, 1: Layla, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. The context suggests that Mimi is leaving Layla to give someone some space and time to collect their thoughts. Logically, it makes more sense that Layla is the one who needs space and time to think, rather than Mimi who is actively leaving. Therefore, ""she"" in this context most likely refers to Layla.",1,1

1. The sentence starts with ""Turkistani admits being opposed to Osama bin Laden""
2. Then it continues with ""but he denies that he was involved in any plots""

The pronoun ""he"" in this context is more likely to refer to Turkistani for the following reasons:
1. Turkistani is the subject of the first part of the sentence.
2. The sentence structure suggests that the same person who admits being opposed to Osama bin Laden is also denying involvement in plots.
3. It would be illogical for Osama bin Laden to deny involvement in plots in this context, as the sentence is primarily about Turkistani's stance.

2. ""and when he hits her back"" - This is the key part for determining who ""he"" refers to.
   - ""he"" is hitting ""her"" back, which implies that ""he"" is responding to the initial hit.
   - ""her"" is used, which is confusing given the names Bob and Anthony are typically male names.
3. ""she is in utter shock"" - This further complicates the pronoun usage, as now we have a ""she"" involved.

Given the structure of the sentence, ""he"" most likely refers to Anthony, as Anthony would be the one hitting back in response to Bob's initial hit. The use of ""her"" and ""she"" later in the sentence is inconsistent with the names given, but doesn't change the fact that ""he"" in this context appears to refer to Anthony.",1,1
1245,Morris is killed by Dracula when he tries to stake the vampire in his coffin.,he,"0: Morris, 1: Dracula, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""he"" refers to. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""when he tries to stake the vampire in his coffin."" Let's analyze the context:

1. Morris is the subject of the first part of the sentence, being killed by Dracula.
2. The action of trying to stake the vampire (Dracula) is attributed to ""he.""
3. It's logical that Morris, as a potential vampire hunter, would be the one trying to stake Dracula, not the other way around.
4. Dracula is referred to as ""the vampire"" in the latter part of the sentence, indicating that ""he"" is not Dracula.

Given this analysis, it's clear that ""he"" refers to Morris, as he is the one attempting to stake Dracula (the vampire) in his coffin.",0,0
1246,Dr. Kim presided over the Espionage Act case against Dr. Stephen Jin-Woo Kim after he told a reporter that North Korea would test its nuclear program.,he,"0: Dr. Kim, 1: Dr. Stephen Jin-Woo Kim, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Dr. Stephen Jin-Woo Kim. The reasoning is as follows:

1. The sentence mentions two people with the surname Kim: Dr. Kim and Dr. Stephen Jin-Woo Kim.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the context of someone telling a reporter about North Korea's nuclear program.
3. The sentence structure suggests that Dr. Kim presided over the case against Dr. Stephen Jin-Woo Kim, implying that they are two different people.
4. The action of telling a reporter about North Korea's nuclear program is more likely to be associated with the person being prosecuted under the Espionage Act (Dr. Stephen Jin-Woo Kim) rather than the person presiding over the case (Dr. Kim).

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Dr. Stephen Jin-Woo Kim, who is the subject of the Espionage Act case and the one who shared information with a reporter.",1,1
1247,"Jane tries to explain to Celia, but she ends their marriage and leaves for America with Darren.",she,"0: Jane, 1: Celia, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Celia. The context suggests that Jane is trying to explain something to Celia, but Celia is the one who takes action by ending their marriage and leaving for America. This interpretation is supported by the following points:

1. Jane is the subject of the first clause, trying to explain something.
2. Celia is the object of the first clause, receiving the explanation.
3. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the second clause to describe someone who ends the marriage and leaves.
4. It would be more logical for Celia to be the one ending the marriage and leaving, as she is the one receiving an explanation (possibly about a problematic situation).
5. The action of ending the marriage and leaving with Darren implies a decision made by Celia, not Jane.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Celia (candidate 1).",1,1
1248,Nancy sleeps with Rebecca again although the next morning she has regrets.,she,"0: Nancy, 1: Rebecca, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and structure of the sentence:

1. The sentence mentions two people: Nancy and Rebecca.
2. The pronoun ""she"" appears in the clause ""she has regrets.""
3. The word ""although"" introduces a contrast between the first part of the sentence and the second part.
4. The first part describes an action (sleeping together), while the second part describes a feeling (having regrets).

Given this analysis, it's more likely that ""she"" refers to Nancy for the following reasons:
- Nancy is mentioned first in the sentence, making her the primary subject.
- It's more common for the subject of the main clause to be carried over as the subject of a following clause.
- The structure of the sentence suggests that Nancy's action (sleeping with Rebecca) leads to her own regrets, creating a logical flow of events.

While it's possible that Rebecca could have regrets, the sentence structure and context make Nancy the more probable subject of the regrets.",0,"0

1249,Jane pursues Becca and is delighted when she becomes her girlfriend.,she,"0: Jane, 1: Becca, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Jane is the subject of the sentence and is performing the action of pursuing Becca.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""when she becomes her girlfriend.""
3. Logically, the person becoming someone's girlfriend would be the person being pursued, not the pursuer.
4. Therefore, ""she"" in this context most likely refers to Becca, as Becca is the one becoming Jane's girlfriend.

The sentence structure suggests that Jane is the active party (pursuing) and Becca is the one responding to that pursuit (becoming the girlfriend). This makes Becca the most likely referent for ""she"" in this context.",1,1
1250,Jake finally wins Nate back after declaring his love for him in public.,his,"0: Jake, 1: Nate, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""his"" refers to. The pronoun ""his"" is used in the phrase ""declaring his love for him in public."" 

Let's analyze the context:
1. Jake is the subject of the sentence and the one performing the action (winning Nate back and declaring love).
2. Nate is the object of Jake's actions.
3. The phrase ""his love for him"" implies that ""his"" refers to the person doing the loving, while ""him"" refers to the person being loved.

Given this context, it's clear that ""his"" refers to Jake, as Jake is the one declaring love for Nate. Jake is expressing his own love, not Nate's love.

Therefore, the pronoun ""his"" refers to Jake (candidate 0).",0,0
1251,Nate struggles to accept Jake being back and he is shocked when he reveals Hannah Ashworth had sent him letters.,he,"0: Nate, 1: Jake, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""he"" refers to: Nate or Jake. Let's analyze the context:

1. The first part of the sentence is about Nate struggling to accept Jake being back.
2. The second part of the sentence uses ""he"" and talks about revealing something about Hannah Ashworth.

Given the structure of the sentence, it's more likely that ""he"" refers to Jake rather than Nate. This is because:

1. Jake is the most recently mentioned person before ""he"" is used.
2. The revelation about Hannah Ashworth sending letters seems to be new information, which is more likely to come from Jake (who has just returned) rather than Nate.
3. The sentence structure suggests a contrast between Nate's struggle to accept Jake's return and the shocking revelation, implying that Jake is the one revealing the information.

Therefore, based on this reasoning, ""he"" most likely refers to Jake.",1,1
1252,"Tanya begins to avoid Mandy after seeing her, so she confronts her about why he left her abroad.",her,"0: Tanya, 1: Mandy, 2: Neither","In this sentence, there are multiple instances of the pronoun 'her', and we need to determine which one refers to the candidate. Let's break it down:

1. 'Tanya begins to avoid Mandy after seeing her' - This 'her' likely refers to Mandy, as Tanya is seeing Mandy.
2. 'so she confronts her' - Here, 'she' is likely Mandy (confronting Tanya), and 'her' refers to Tanya.
3. 'about why he left her abroad' - This 'her' is ambiguous and could refer to either Tanya or Mandy.

Given that the question asks about the pronoun 'her' without specifying which instance, and there are multiple uses that refer to both Tanya and Mandy, it's not possible to definitively choose one candidate over the other. The pronoun 'her' is used to refer to both Tanya and Mandy at different points in the sentence.",1,2
1253,"Tanya then ends the affair with Sinead, and after speaking to Diane she agrees to get married again.",she,"0: Tanya, 1: Sinead, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""she"" refers to when it says ""she agrees to get married again."" Let's analyze the context:

1. Tanya ends the affair with Sinead.
2. After speaking to Diane, ""she"" agrees to get married again.

The pronoun ""she"" is more likely to refer to Tanya for the following reasons:
1. Tanya is the subject of the first part of the sentence, making her the more prominent character.
2. The action of agreeing to get married again logically follows the action of ending an affair, suggesting a continuity of focus on Tanya.
3. There's no indication that Sinead was previously married or considering marriage, while the phrase ""get married again"" implies a previous marriage, which is more likely to apply to Tanya in this context.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Tanya.",1,0
1254,"Souness thanked Platini, but declined the offer, citing dressing room harmony as his reason.",his,"0: Souness, 1: Platini, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""his"" refers to Souness for the following reasons:

1. Souness is the subject of the sentence and the main actor performing the actions (thanking and declining).
2. The pronoun ""his"" is used in the context of explaining Souness's reason for declining the offer.
3. It would not make sense for ""his"" to refer to Platini, as Platini is not the one declining the offer or citing a reason.
4. The phrase ""dressing room harmony"" is more likely to be a concern for Souness, who is implied to be in a position of authority (likely a coach or manager), rather than Platini, who is making an offer.

Therefore, the pronoun ""his"" clearly refers to Souness in this context.",0,0
1255,"While Mark deliberates whether to trust Dimble, he is found by police and arrested for Hingest's murder.",he,"0: Mark, 1: Dimble, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Mark for the following reasons:

1. Mark is the subject of the first part of the sentence, making him the most prominent character in the context.
2. The sentence structure suggests that the same person who is deliberating (Mark) is also the one who is found and arrested.
3. The action of being found and arrested logically follows the deliberation about trusting Dimble, indicating a continuation of events related to Mark.
4. There is no indication in the sentence that the subject changes from Mark to Dimble.

Therefore, based on the context and sentence structure, ""he"" most likely refers to Mark.",0,0
1256,"Emperor Taizong spared Ashina Duobi but he detained him at Chang ` an, and he considered what to do with the Eastern Tujue people.",him,"0: Emperor Taizong, 1: Ashina Duobi, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""him"" refers to Ashina Duobi. The sentence structure indicates that Emperor Taizong took an action towards Ashina Duobi, which was detaining him at Chang'an. The pronoun ""him"" is used to avoid repeating Ashina Duobi's name in the same sentence. It's clear that Emperor Taizong is the subject performing the action, and Ashina Duobi is the object being detained, so ""him"" must refer to Ashina Duobi.",0,1
1257,"The major-general was named as one of the king's judges, but, like Fairfax, did not take his place.",his,"0: the king, 1: The major-general, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""his"" most likely refers to ""The major-general"" for the following reasons:

1. The major-general is the main subject of the sentence and is mentioned first.
2. The phrase ""did not take his place"" is directly connected to the action of being named as one of the king's judges, which is attributed to the major-general.
3. The king is mentioned only in a possessive form (""king's judges"") and is not the primary actor in the sentence.
4. The comparison with Fairfax (""like Fairfax"") suggests that the major-general's action is being described, not the king's.

Therefore, ""his"" in this context refers to the major-general's place as one of the king's judges, which he did not take.",1,1
1258,"Calchas could n't equal Mopsus' skills as a seer, being a son of Apollo and Manto, so he died.",he,"0: Mopsus, 1: Calchas, 2: Neither","In the given text, the pronoun 'he' refers to Calchas. The sentence structure indicates that Calchas is the subject who couldn't equal Mopsus' skills and consequently died. The phrase 'so he died' is directly connected to Calchas' inability to match Mopsus' abilities as a seer. Therefore, 'he' in this context refers to Calchas.",1,1
1259,"Charles becomes suspicious of Brian, but he keeps his thoughts to himself.",his,"0: Charles, 1: Brian, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""his"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence has two subjects: Charles and Brian.
2. The pronoun ""his"" is used in the second part of the sentence, after the comma.
3. The phrase ""keeps his thoughts to himself"" is more likely to refer to the person who becomes suspicious, rather than the person being suspected.
4. Charles is the subject who becomes suspicious of Brian.

Based on this analysis, it's more logical that ""his"" refers to Charles, as he is the one who has become suspicious and would be keeping his thoughts to himself about his suspicions.",0,0
1260,"Paul Scofield was Lean's first choice for the part of Shaughnessy, but he was unable to escape a theatre commitment.",he,"0: Lean, 1: Paul Scofield, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Paul Scofield. The sentence structure indicates that Paul Scofield was considered for a part but couldn't take it due to a prior commitment. The pronoun ""he"" is used to refer back to Paul Scofield in the second part of the sentence, explaining why he couldn't take the role. Lean is mentioned as the person making the choice, but is not the subject of the inability to escape a commitment.",1,1
1261,"Hinckley did not hit Reagan directly, but he seriously wounded him when a bullet ricocheted off the side of the presidential limousine and hit him in the chest.",him,"0: Hinckley, 1: Reagan, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""him"" appears twice. Let's analyze each occurrence:

1. First ""him"": ""...but he seriously wounded him...""
   This ""him"" clearly refers to Reagan, as Hinckley is the one who wounded Reagan.

2. Second ""him"": ""...and hit him in the chest.""
   This ""him"" also refers to Reagan, as it's describing where Reagan was hit by the ricocheted bullet.

Both instances of ""him"" in this sentence refer to Reagan, not Hinckley. The sentence is describing how Hinckley's actions affected Reagan, making Reagan the object (him) of Hinckley's actions.",1,1
1262,Nathan warns Vince that if he does n't return the money he will tell Rod.,he,"0: Nathan, 1: Vince, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. Nathan is the subject of the main clause, warning Vince.
2. The pronoun ""he"" appears in the subordinate clause ""if he doesn't return the money.""
3. Logically, Nathan would be warning Vince about Vince's own actions, not Nathan's.
4. The consequence ""he will tell Rod"" also makes more sense if it refers to Nathan telling Rod about Vince not returning the money.

Given this analysis, it's most likely that ""he"" refers to Vince, as Nathan is warning Vince about the consequences of Vince's potential actions (not returning the money).",1,1
1263,"Kuwabara is friends with Toya Meijin, but rivals Ogata, whose challenge he defeats.",he,"0: Kuwabara, 1: Toya Meijin, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Kuwabara"" as the main subject.
2. It mentions that Kuwabara is friends with Toya Meijin.
3. The sentence then introduces a new clause about Kuwabara's rivalry with Ogata.
4. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the context of defeating Ogata's challenge.

Given this structure, it's most likely that ""he"" refers to Kuwabara for the following reasons:
- Kuwabara is the main subject of the sentence.
- The pronoun is used in a clause that continues to describe Kuwabara's actions (defeating a rival's challenge).
- There's no shift in focus to Toya Meijin that would warrant using ""he"" to refer to him.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Kuwabara.",1,0
1264,"Gullit was replaced by Bruce Arena, but he was not able to lead LA into a play-off spot, for the third-straight season.",he,"0: Gullit, 1: Bruce Arena, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Bruce Arena. The context suggests that Bruce Arena replaced Gullit, and then the sentence continues to describe what happened after this replacement. The phrase ""but he was not able to lead LA into a play-off spot"" is describing Bruce Arena's performance after taking over from Gullit. It wouldn't make sense for ""he"" to refer to Gullit, as Gullit had already been replaced at this point in the narrative.",0,1
1265,"Paul tries to comfort Zack, but he rejects him and heads back to base with the intent to DOR himself.",he,"0: Paul, 1: Zack, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Zack. We can determine this based on the context:

1. Paul is trying to comfort Zack.
2. ""He"" rejects ""him"" - this indicates that Zack is rejecting Paul's attempt to comfort him.
3. ""He"" then heads back to base with the intent to DOR himself. DOR likely stands for ""Drop on Request,"" which is a military term for voluntarily leaving a training program. This action aligns more with Zack's state of mind, as he's the one being comforted and potentially struggling.

Therefore, ""he"" in this context refers to Zack, not Paul.",1,1
1266,"Sam arrives and tries to speak to Dom again, but he does not want to see him, and asks him to leave.",he,"0: Sam, 1: Dom, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. ""Sam arrives and tries to speak to Dom again"" - This sets up the initial action.
2. ""but he does not want to see him"" - This is where the pronoun ""he"" appears.
3. ""and asks him to leave"" - This provides additional context.

The key is to determine who ""does not want to see"" whom. Given the context:

- Sam is trying to speak to Dom again, implying Sam is the one initiating the interaction.
- The person referred to by ""he"" doesn't want to see the other person.
- This person also asks the other to leave.

These actions (not wanting to see Sam and asking Sam to leave) are more likely to be performed by Dom, as Sam is the one trying to initiate contact. Therefore, ""he"" in this context most likely refers to Dom.",1,1
1267,Juliana did n't trust Katie when she drunk alcohol hence they had made the pact.,she,"0: Juliana, 1: Katie, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Katie. The context suggests that Juliana doesn't trust Katie when Katie drinks alcohol. This interpretation makes the most sense because:

1. The sentence structure implies that Juliana is the subject who doesn't trust someone else (Katie) under certain conditions.
2. It's more logical that Juliana wouldn't trust Katie when Katie is drinking, rather than Juliana not trusting Katie when Juliana herself is drinking.
3. The mention of ""they had made the pact"" further supports this interpretation, suggesting that Juliana and Katie made an agreement, possibly related to Katie's alcohol consumption.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" in this context refers to Katie (candidate 1).",1,1
1268,"James invites Jordan to a three-on-three match but when he declines, he questions his loss of talent.",he,"0: Jordan, 1: James, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""he"" refers to. Let's break it down:

1. James invites Jordan to a match.
2. Jordan declines the invitation.
3. Someone questions the loss of talent.

The pronoun ""he"" in the second part of the sentence (""he questions his loss of talent"") is more likely to refer to James for the following reasons:

1. James is the subject of the first action (inviting), which makes him the more prominent actor in the sentence.
2. It's more natural for the person who extended the invitation (James) to question the other person's (Jordan's) decision to decline, rather than Jordan questioning his own decision.
3. The phrase ""loss of talent"" implies that the person being referred to (Jordan) used to have talent but may have lost it, and it's more likely for James to make this judgment about Jordan than for Jordan to make it about himself.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to James.",1,1
1269,"Bill Murray was considered for the role of Pat Healy, but the Farrelly brothers thought he was too old for the part.",he,"0: Bill Murray, 1: Pat Healy, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Bill Murray. The sentence is discussing Bill Murray being considered for a role, and then states that ""he"" was thought to be too old for the part. This ""he"" logically refers back to Bill Murray, as the sentence is about his potential casting and the reason he wasn't chosen. Pat Healy is mentioned only as the name of the role, not as a person being considered for casting.",0,0
1270,"Poulidor was no match for Merckx, although he offered much resistance.",he,"0: Poulidor, 1: Merckx, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Poulidor. The context suggests that Poulidor was not as strong as Merckx, but still put up a fight. The phrase ""he offered much resistance"" is describing Poulidor's actions, not Merckx's. Therefore, ""he"" is referring to Poulidor.",0,0
1271,John Kennedy had a speech drafted calling for the censure of McCarthy but he never delivered it.,he,"0: McCarthy, 1: John Kennedy, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to John Kennedy. The sentence structure indicates that John Kennedy is the main subject who had a speech drafted but didn't deliver it. The pronoun ""he"" is used to avoid repeating John Kennedy's name in the second part of the sentence. McCarthy is mentioned only as the subject of the potential censure, not as the person who had the speech or didn't deliver it.",1,1
1272,Moco's thug captures Azul on the street but let him go when he learns that the case he is carrying contains only a guitar.,him,"0: Moco 's thug, 1: Azul, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""him"" refers to, let's analyze the sentence:

""Moco's thug captures Azul on the street but let him go when he learns that the case he is carrying contains only a guitar.""

In this sentence, ""him"" clearly refers to Azul for the following reasons:
1. Azul is the object of the action ""captures"" performed by Moco's thug.
2. The pronoun ""him"" is used in the phrase ""let him go,"" which logically follows the capture of Azul.
3. The sentence structure indicates that the person being let go is the same person who was captured, which is Azul.

Moco's thug is the subject performing the actions (capturing and letting go), so ""him"" cannot refer to the thug.

Therefore, the pronoun ""him"" refers to Azul, which is candidate 1.",1,1
1273,"Paul said Rodman was selfish about rebounding, but he deemed him a hard worker and coachable.",him,"0: Paul, 1: Rodman, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""him"" refers to, let's analyze the sentence:

1. The sentence structure suggests that Paul is speaking about Rodman.
2. ""him"" is used in the latter part of the sentence, referring to the person being described.
3. The descriptions ""a hard worker and coachable"" are being applied to the person referred to as ""him"".
4. These descriptions are more likely to be about Rodman, as Paul is the one making the statement about someone else.

Given this analysis, it's clear that ""him"" refers to Rodman, not Paul.",1,1
1274,"Angie won't take Jim, but he will take Darlene, who nonetheless insists on bringing Stash along.",he,"0: Angie, 1: Jim, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. ""Angie won't take Jim"" - This establishes that Angie is not taking Jim somewhere.
2. ""but he will take Darlene"" - The pronoun ""he"" is used here, and it refers to a male person.
3. Given the context, ""he"" most likely refers to Jim, as he is the only male mentioned in the sentence.
4. Angie is female, so ""he"" cannot refer to her.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" in this sentence clearly refers to Jim.",0,1
1275,The women find the dancers familiar since they saw the same people perform the first time they saw the show.,they,"0: The women, 1: the dancers, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and meaning of the sentence:

1. The sentence is about ""The women"" finding ""the dancers"" familiar.
2. The reason given for this familiarity is that ""they saw the same people perform the first time they saw the show.""
3. The pronoun ""they"" in this context is referring to the subject of the sentence, which is ""The women.""
4. It makes logical sense that the women are the ones who saw the dancers perform before, not the other way around.
5. The dancers are the ones being recognized, not the ones doing the recognizing.

Therefore, the pronoun ""they"" most likely refers to ""The women"" in this sentence.",0,0
1276,"Banai was found by the old lady, when she was abandoned on earth by an angry Indra.",she,"0: Banai, 1: the old lady, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions two female entities: Banai and the old lady.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""when she was abandoned on earth.""
3. Logically, it makes more sense that Banai was abandoned on earth, rather than the old lady.
4. The sentence structure suggests that Banai is the main subject, and the information about being abandoned is additional information about her.
5. It would be unusual for the old lady to be abandoned on earth by Indra in this context.

Based on these points, it is most likely that ""she"" refers to Banai.",0,0
1277,"Jason has two sons by Mark, but he later decides to opt out of his union with him in favor of a marriage to the Corinthian princess Glauce.",he,"0: Jason, 1: Mark, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and sentence structure:

1. The sentence starts with ""Jason has two sons by Mark,"" establishing both Jason and Mark as potential referents.
2. The pronoun ""he"" appears in the clause ""but he later decides to opt out of his union with him.""
3. The use of ""him"" later in the sentence suggests that ""he"" refers to a different person than ""him.""
4. The action of deciding ""to opt out of his union"" and entering into ""a marriage to the Corinthian princess Glauce"" implies that ""he"" is the one making these decisions.
5. Given the context, it's more logical that Jason would be the one opting out of the union and marrying someone else, rather than Mark.

Based on these points, we can conclude that ""he"" most likely refers to Jason.",0,0
1278,"Once more the frogs appealed to the Gods, but this time they replied that they must face the consequences of their request.",they,"0: the Gods, 1: the frogs, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" refers to ""the Gods"" for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure indicates that ""they"" is the subject of the verb ""replied"".
2. The Gods are the last mentioned entity before the pronoun ""they"" appears.
3. It makes logical sense in the context that the Gods would be the ones replying to the frogs' appeal.
4. The frogs are mentioned as making the appeal, so it wouldn't make sense for them to be replying to their own appeal.

Therefore, ""they"" most likely refers to ""the Gods"" in this context.",0,0
1279,Lurie claimed that Dennis Hopper was so high on sugar during his two-part episode that he was unable to concentrate long enough to fish.,his,"0: Lurie, 1: Dennis Hopper, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""his"" is most likely referring to Dennis Hopper. The context of the sentence suggests that Dennis Hopper was the one who was ""high on sugar"" and unable to concentrate during ""his two-part episode."" This implies that Dennis Hopper was starring in or featured in a two-part episode of something, likely a TV show or film. The inability to concentrate and fish is also attributed to Dennis Hopper's state, not Lurie's. Lurie is simply making a claim about Dennis Hopper's condition.",1,1
1280,"Beatrice warms to an appreciative Peggy, although she tells her about her sordid past.",she,"0: Beatrice, 1: an appreciative Peggy, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""she"" refers to. The sentence structure suggests that ""she"" refers to Beatrice for the following reasons:

1. Beatrice is the subject of the main clause ""Beatrice warms to an appreciative Peggy"".
2. The pronoun ""she"" appears in the subordinate clause ""although she tells her about her sordid past"".
3. It's more logical that Beatrice would be telling Peggy about her own past, rather than Peggy telling Beatrice about Peggy's past.
4. The flow of the sentence indicates that Beatrice is the main actor, warming to Peggy and then telling her something.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Beatrice.",1,0
1281,"Novalee finds Wanda in the hospital bed after she finds out she was in accident, causing her to get her legs amputated.",she,"0: Novalee, 1: Wanda, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. ""Novalee finds Wanda in the hospital bed"" - This establishes that Wanda is in the hospital bed.

2. ""after she finds out she was in accident"" - Here we have two instances of ""she"":
   - The first ""she"" likely refers to Novalee, as she is the one finding out about the accident.
   - The second ""she"" refers to the person who was in the accident, which is Wanda (since she's in the hospital bed).

3. ""causing her to get her legs amputated"" - This ""her"" refers to the person who was in the accident and is now in the hospital bed, which is Wanda.

Given that the pronoun we're asked about is ""she,"" and we're looking at the sentence as a whole, the most prominent ""she"" in this context refers to Wanda. She's the one who was in the accident and had her legs amputated.",0,1
1282,Robic moved to Bruce when he was seven and lived at Radenac.,he,"0: Robic, 1: Bruce, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Robic moved to Bruce,"" indicating that Robic is the subject performing the action.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""when he was seven,"" which provides additional information about the subject of the sentence.
3. It's more likely that the age information (being seven) refers to the person who moved (Robic) rather than the place they moved to (Bruce).
4. The sentence continues with ""and lived at Radenac,"" which further describes the actions of the subject (Robic).

Based on this analysis, it's most logical that ""he"" refers to Robic, as the sentence is describing Robic's actions and providing information about his age when he moved.",0,0
1283,"Liana throws Cindy out, so Liam hides her in his room, which Carol eventually discovers.",her,"0: Liana, 1: Cindy, 2: Neither","Let's analyze the sentence step by step:

1. ""Liana throws Cindy out"" - This establishes that Cindy is being removed from somewhere.
2. ""so Liam hides her in his room"" - The pronoun ""her"" is used here, referring to the person being hidden.
3. Given that Cindy was just thrown out, it makes logical sense that she would be the one needing to be hidden.
4. Liana, being the one doing the throwing out, would not need to be hidden.

Therefore, the pronoun ""her"" most likely refers to Cindy.",1,1
1284,"Aviation magnate Samantha Williams is engaged to the much-younger Heather, but she is unaware that she previously had an affair with her son, Chandler.",she,"0: the much-younger Heather, 1: Aviation magnate Samantha Williams, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence starts by introducing Samantha Williams and Heather.
2. The first ""she"" in the sentence is more likely to refer to Samantha Williams because:
   a) Samantha is the main subject of the sentence.
   b) The phrase ""but she is unaware"" implies that this person is in a position of less knowledge, which fits with Samantha not knowing about the affair.
3. The second ""she"" in ""she previously had an affair"" also likely refers to Samantha Williams because:
   a) It's talking about a past event (the affair with her son).
   b) It wouldn't make sense for Heather to have had an affair with Samantha's son if Heather is much younger and currently engaged to Samantha.

Given this analysis, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Samantha Williams.",0,1
1285,Devon attempts to convince Cain to stay but he leaves and gives him some money.,he,"0: Devon, 1: Cain, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Devon is trying to convince Cain to stay.
2. Someone leaves.
3. Someone gives money to the other person.

The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""he leaves and gives him some money."" This action is more likely to be associated with Cain for the following reasons:

1. Devon is trying to convince Cain to stay, which implies that Cain is the one intending to leave.
2. The act of leaving is contrary to Devon's apparent desire (to have Cain stay).
3. Giving money is often associated with the person who is leaving, as a parting gesture.

Therefore, it is most logical to conclude that ""he"" refers to Cain in this context.",1,1
1286,Kagan proposed that Riesch failed to act more aggressively because he had lost faith in Mack's ability.,he,"0: Kagan, 1: Riesch, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Riesch. The sentence structure suggests that Kagan is making a statement about Riesch's actions and motivations. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause explaining why Riesch allegedly failed to act more aggressively. It wouldn't make sense for ""he"" to refer to Kagan in this context, as Kagan is the one proposing the explanation, not the subject of the explanation. Therefore, ""he"" must refer to Riesch.",0,1
1287,Anthony is arrested and assumes that Pete is responsible because he saw him load the merchandise into his locker.,he,"0: Anthony, 1: Pete, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Anthony is arrested.
2. Anthony assumes Pete is responsible.
3. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the phrase ""he saw him load the merchandise into his locker.""

Given this information, it's most logical that ""he"" refers to Anthony. The sentence is describing Anthony's perspective and his reason for assuming Pete is responsible. It makes sense that Anthony saw Pete loading merchandise, which led to his assumption of Pete's guilt.

If ""he"" referred to Pete, the sentence wouldn't make sense in context, as Pete wouldn't be the one making assumptions about his own actions.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Anthony.",1,0
1288,"Denise is initially hostile to Lucy, but she warms to him when she sees he has changed and they eventually reunite.",she,"0: Denise, 1: Lucy, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. ""Denise is initially hostile to Lucy"" - This establishes Denise as the subject and Lucy as the object.
2. ""but she warms to him"" - Here, ""she"" refers to the subject (Denise), and ""him"" refers to the object (Lucy).
3. ""when she sees he has changed"" - Again, ""she"" refers to Denise, and ""he"" refers to Lucy.
4. ""and they eventually reunite"" - ""They"" refers to both Denise and Lucy.

The pronoun ""she"" is used consistently to refer to Denise throughout the sentence. It's clear that ""she"" is the subject of the actions (being hostile, warming up, seeing the change), and these actions are being performed in relation to Lucy, who is referred to as ""him"" and ""he"".

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" in this context refers to Denise.",0,0
1289,Denise eventually moved in with Lana when she fell out with her sister Kim Fox for a brief time.,she,"0: Denise, 1: Lana, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions three people: Denise, Lana, and Kim Fox.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""when she fell out with her sister Kim Fox.""
3. This implies that ""she"" refers to the person who has a sister named Kim Fox.
4. Given the information provided, it's most likely that Denise is the one who has a sister named Kim Fox, as there's no indication that Lana is related to Kim Fox.
5. The sentence structure also suggests that Denise is the main subject, as she is the one who ""moved in with Lana.""

Based on this analysis, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Denise.",0,0
1290,Matthew comes in and tries to pull Samuel away but he pushes him away and continues strangling Steve.,he,"0: Matthew, 1: Samuel, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. Matthew comes in and tries to pull Samuel away.
2. ""He"" pushes him away.
3. ""He"" continues strangling Steve.

The pronoun ""he"" is used to refer to the person who is pushing away and strangling. Based on the context, it's clear that Samuel is the one who is being aggressive (strangling Steve) and resisting Matthew's attempt to pull him away. Therefore, ""he"" most likely refers to Samuel.

Matthew is trying to stop the action, while Samuel is the one continuing the aggressive behavior. The pronoun ""he"" is used to describe the person who is pushing away and continuing to strangle, which aligns with Samuel's actions in this scenario.",1,1
1291,Keijun received Miyabe Castle from Azai Nagamasa when he gave his support to the Azai clan.,he,"0: Keijun, 1: Azai Nagamasa, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Keijun. The sentence structure indicates that Keijun is the subject who received Miyabe Castle from Azai Nagamasa. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""when he gave his support to the Azai clan,"" which describes Keijun's action of giving support. It wouldn't make sense for Azai Nagamasa to give support to his own clan, so ""he"" must refer to Keijun.",0,0
1292,"Its possible that Malebranche also influenced George Berkeley, although he rejects any association with him beyond superficial similarities.",he,"0: Malebranche, 1: George Berkeley, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to George Berkeley. The context suggests that George Berkeley is the subject who is rejecting an association with Malebranche. This interpretation makes the most sense because:

1. The sentence is discussing the potential influence of Malebranche on George Berkeley.
2. The latter part of the sentence mentions someone rejecting an association, which is more likely to be the person being influenced (Berkeley) rather than the influencer (Malebranche).
3. It's more natural for Berkeley to be the one rejecting an association with Malebranche, as he would be the one responding to comparisons or claims of influence.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to George Berkeley.",1,1
1293,"Jay later tells Abel, but then he lies and says he made it up when he sees how upset he is.",he,"0: Jay, 1: Abel, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. ""Jay later tells Abel"" - This establishes Jay as the subject who is doing the telling.
2. ""but then he lies"" - This ""he"" is likely referring to Jay, as he's the one who told Abel something and is now lying about it.
3. ""and says he made it up"" - Again, this ""he"" is most likely Jay, continuing the action from the previous clause.
4. ""when he sees how upset he is"" - The first ""he"" in this part is still likely Jay, seeing the reaction. The second ""he"" refers to Abel, who is upset about what he was told.

The pronoun ""he"" appears multiple times in this sentence, but the question asks about a specific instance. Given the candidates provided (Jay, Abel, or Neither), and considering the overall context, the most logical interpretation is that the ""he"" who lies and says he made it up is Jay.",0,0
1294,"Maxime attempts to reconcile with Vanessa, but she informs her that their relationship will never be serious.",she,"0: Maxime, 1: Vanessa, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" is used to refer to Vanessa. We can determine this because:

1. The sentence structure indicates that Maxime is the subject performing the action of attempting to reconcile.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is then used to introduce the response to Maxime's action.
3. The phrase ""informs her"" suggests that ""she"" (Vanessa) is speaking to ""her"" (Maxime).
4. The content of the message (""their relationship will never be serious"") is something that Vanessa would say in response to Maxime's reconciliation attempt.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" refers to Vanessa in this context.",1,1
1295,"Ginette wants to hug Susanna, but she notices that the tobacco smell comes from her clothes.",she,"0: Ginette, 1: Susanna, 2: Neither","To determine who ""she"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and the logical flow of the sentence.

1. The sentence starts with ""Ginette wants to hug Susanna.""
2. Then it says ""but she notices...""

The use of ""but"" indicates a contrast or obstacle to the action of hugging. It's more likely that the person who wants to hug (Ginette) would be the one to notice something that might prevent or affect the hug.

Furthermore, the sentence ends with ""...the tobacco smell comes from her clothes."" This suggests that the clothes belonging to the person being hugged (Susanna) are the source of the tobacco smell.

Given this analysis, it's most logical that ""she"" refers to Ginette, as she is the one who wants to hug and would be in the position to notice the smell on Susanna's clothes.",0,0
1296,"Johnny decides to flee to South America with Nate, but not before brazenly cashing in his share of the casino.",his,"0: Johnny, 1: Nate, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""his"" refers to Johnny for the following reasons:

1. Johnny is the subject of the sentence and the main actor in the described action.
2. The phrase ""his share of the casino"" implies ownership or a stake in the casino.
3. The context suggests that Johnny is the one making the decision to flee and cash in his share, indicating that the share belongs to him.
4. There is no indication that Nate has any ownership or share in the casino.

Therefore, it is most logical to conclude that ""his"" refers to Johnny's share of the casino.",0,0
1297,"Micheal returns the greeting to Serge after he greets him on the S.S. Zelbess, bored after the performance.",he,"0: Micheal, 1: Serge, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence describes two actions: 
   - Micheal returns the greeting
   - Serge greets him (Micheal)

2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""after he greets him"". 

3. In this context, ""he"" is performing the action of greeting, while ""him"" is receiving the greeting.

4. Since we know that Serge is the one who initially greets Micheal (as Micheal is returning the greeting), ""he"" must refer to Serge.

5. The pronoun ""him"" in this case refers to Micheal, but we're not asked about ""him"".

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" in this sentence refers to Serge.",1,1
1298,"Nigeria international Jayson Obazuaye was also brought in by Coach Jones, but his transfer fell through due to the club not receiving international clearance for the player.",his,"0: Coach Jones, 1: Nigeria international Jayson Obazuaye, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""his"" refers to Nigeria international Jayson Obazuaye. The context indicates that Jayson Obazuaye was brought in by Coach Jones, but then ""his transfer fell through."" The transfer being discussed is clearly that of Jayson Obazuaye, not Coach Jones. Therefore, ""his"" in this context refers to Jayson Obazuaye.",0,1
1299,"Cathy realizes that Heather has overheard, so she is overcome by guilt and she runs out after her into a raging storm.",her,"0: Cathy, 1: Heather, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""her"" the pronoun refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Cathy realizes that Heather has overheard""
2. Then it says ""so she is overcome by guilt""
3. Finally, it states ""and she runs out after her into a raging storm""

The pronoun ""her"" in question is in the last part of the sentence: ""runs out after her"". 

To determine who ""her"" refers to, we need to consider who is doing the action of running out. The subject of this action is likely the same person who is ""overcome by guilt"". Given the context, it's most logical that Cathy is the one feeling guilty (for something Heather overheard) and thus Cathy is the one running out.

If Cathy is running out, then ""her"" must refer to the person Cathy is running after, which would be Heather.

Therefore, the pronoun ""her"" in this context refers to Heather.",1,1
1300,"While former cabinet minister Joe Fontana is still supporting Kennedy, he has since resigned his seat in the House of Commons to run for Mayor of London.",he,"0: Kennedy, 1: former cabinet minister Joe Fontana, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Joe Fontana. The sentence structure indicates that Joe Fontana is the main subject of the actions described. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the second part of the sentence to refer back to Joe Fontana, who is mentioned by name in the first part. The actions attributed to ""he"" (resigning his seat and running for Mayor of London) are logically connected to Joe Fontana, not Kennedy. Kennedy is only mentioned as the person Fontana is supporting, but is not the main subject of the sentence.",0,1
1301,Azuth is one of Marcus' subordinates but he is also known to be a friend and advisor to him.,he,"0: Azuth, 1: Marcus, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine whether the pronoun ""he"" refers to Azuth (0) or Marcus (1). Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence starts by introducing Azuth as one of Marcus' subordinates.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the second part of the sentence.
3. The sentence states that ""he is also known to be a friend and advisor to him.""

Given this information, it's more likely that ""he"" refers to Azuth for the following reasons:
- The sentence is primarily about Azuth, introducing him as the subject.
- The use of ""also"" suggests that we're adding more information about the subject (Azuth).
- It would be redundant to say Marcus is a friend and advisor to himself, so ""him"" at the end likely refers to Marcus.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Azuth.",0,0
1302,"Murong Ke declined persuading Murong Jun that if his abilities were capable of ruling over the empire, then they were also capable of assisting the young emperor.",his,"0: Murong Ke, 1: Murong Jun, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""his"" refers to Murong Ke. The context suggests that Murong Ke is declining to persuade Murong Jun about something related to Murong Ke's own abilities. The phrase ""if his abilities were capable of ruling over the empire"" is part of what Murong Ke is declining to say to Murong Jun, and it's referring to Murong Ke's own abilities, not Murong Jun's. Therefore, ""his"" in this context refers to Murong Ke.",1,0
1303,The doctor admonished the parent when he learned that he had consciously withheld the insulin.,he,"0: The doctor, 1: the parent, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""he"" refers to: the doctor or the parent. Let's analyze the context:

1. The first ""he"" in ""when he learned"" likely refers to the doctor. It's more probable that the doctor would learn about the withholding of insulin, as they are in a position to receive and assess medical information.

2. The second ""he"" in ""he had consciously withheld the insulin"" refers to the parent. This is because:
   a) It's unlikely that a doctor would withhold insulin from a patient.
   b) The doctor is admonishing the parent, which suggests the parent did something wrong.
   c) Parents are typically responsible for administering medication to their children, so withholding insulin would be an action associated with the parent.

Since the pronoun we're asked about is the first ""he"" in the sentence, it most likely refers to the doctor.",0,0
1304,Valerie forgives Amy that she did not back her up and goes to visit her son.,her,"0: Valerie, 1: Amy, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. The pronoun ""her"" appears twice in the sentence.
2. The first ""her"" in ""back her up"" clearly refers to Valerie, as the context suggests that Valerie expected Amy to back her up.
3. The second ""her"" in ""her son"" is the one we need to focus on.
4. The sentence structure suggests that the person visiting the son is the same person who is forgiving, which is Valerie.
5. It's more likely that Valerie is visiting her own son rather than Amy's son in this context.

Therefore, the pronoun ""her"" in ""her son"" most likely refers to Valerie.",1,0
1305,Louise tries to kill Joy but she pleads and tells her that both of them were cheated on by their spouses.,she,"0: Louise, 1: Joy, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Louise is trying to kill Joy.
2. ""She"" pleads and tells Louise something.

Given this information, it's clear that ""she"" refers to Joy because:
- Joy is the one in the position of pleading, as she's the one being attacked.
- It wouldn't make sense for Louise to plead with Joy while trying to kill her.
- The information being shared (about both of them being cheated on) is likely coming from Joy as a way to create empathy and stop Louise from killing her.

Therefore, ""she"" in this context refers to Joy.",1,1
1306,"Veronica attempts to visit Susan, but her father turns her away.",her,"0: Veronica, 1: Susan, 2: Neither","In the sentence 'Veronica attempts to visit Susan, but her father turns her away,' we need to determine which 'her' the pronoun refers to. The pronoun 'her' appears twice in this sentence, but we're focusing on the first occurrence: 'her father.' In this context, 'her father' is more likely to refer to Susan's father rather than Veronica's father. This is because Susan is the person being visited, and it's more logical that Susan's father would be the one turning Veronica away. Therefore, 'her' in this case refers to Susan.",1,1
1307,"Francesca immediately becomes annoyed with Harriet when she throws a snowball, causing her to drop a large pile of presents.",she,"0: Francesca, 1: Harriet, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Francesca immediately becomes annoyed with Harriet.""
2. The next part states ""when she throws a snowball.""
3. The final part says ""causing her to drop a large pile of presents.""

The pronoun ""she"" in this context refers to the person who throws the snowball. Since Francesca is described as becoming annoyed with Harriet, it's logical to conclude that Harriet is the one who threw the snowball, causing Francesca's annoyance.

The pronoun ""her"" in the last part likely refers to Francesca, as she is the one who becomes annoyed and presumably drops the presents as a result of the snowball throw.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" in this sentence refers to Harriet.",1,1
1308,"Leo also approaches Namor, but he rejects the offer stating he is not a villain anymore.",he,"0: Leo, 1: Namor, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""he"" refers to: Leo or Namor. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""he rejects the offer stating he is not a villain anymore."" This action of rejecting the offer and stating that he is not a villain anymore is more likely to be associated with Namor for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure suggests that Leo is the one approaching Namor, making Namor the recipient of the action.
2. The statement about not being a villain anymore implies a character development or change, which is more likely to be associated with Namor, as he is a known character in comics who has had both heroic and villainous roles.
3. Leo, being the one approaching and presumably making the offer, is less likely to be rejecting his own offer.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" in this context most likely refers to Namor.",1,1
1309,"Seneca had some personal reason for satirizing Claudius, because the emperor had banished him to Corsica.",him,"0: Seneca, 1: Claudius, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""him"" refers to Seneca, not Claudius. The reasoning is as follows:

1. The sentence states that Seneca had a personal reason for satirizing Claudius.
2. The latter part of the sentence explains this reason: ""because the emperor had banished him to Corsica.""
3. Claudius is referred to as ""the emperor"" in this context.
4. Therefore, ""him"" must refer to the person who was banished, which is Seneca.

The pronoun ""him"" is used as the object of the verb ""banished,"" and it's clear from the context that Seneca is the one who was banished by Claudius (the emperor), not the other way around.",1,0
1310,Veronica hates Megan Laurence because she had raped and drugged her when she was pregnant with Natalie.,she,"0: Megan Laurence, 1: Veronica, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence starts with ""Veronica hates Megan Laurence because...""
2. The pronoun ""she"" appears twice in the sentence.
3. The first ""she"" is the subject of ""had raped and drugged her""
4. The second ""she"" is the object of ""when she was pregnant""

Given this information:
- The first ""she"" clearly refers to Megan Laurence, as Veronica hates her for this action.
- The second ""she"" refers to Veronica, as she was the one who was pregnant.

Since the question asks about the first occurrence of ""she"" in the sentence, we can conclude that it refers to Megan Laurence.",1,0
1311,"Nate moves on and becomes involved with FBI agent John McBain, but he feels guilt over Cristian's death.",he,"0: Nate, 1: FBI agent John McBain, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Nate for the following reasons:

1. Nate is the subject of the first part of the sentence, making him the most prominent character.
2. The sentence structure suggests that the same person who ""moves on and becomes involved with FBI agent John McBain"" is the one who ""feels guilt over Cristian's death.""
3. It would be unusual for John McBain to feel guilt over Cristian's death, as he is introduced as a new character in Nate's life.
4. The feeling of guilt implies a connection to past events, which aligns more with Nate's character arc than with John McBain's.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Nate.",1,0
1312,"Afterwards, Malcolm then mentions what happens to Spath afterwards and he debates whether he feels sorry for him or not.",he,"0: Spath, 1: Malcolm, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""he"" refers to: Spath or Malcolm. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Afterwards, Malcolm then mentions..."" This indicates that Malcolm is the subject performing the action of mentioning.

2. The pronoun ""he"" appears in the latter part of the sentence: ""...and he debates whether he feels sorry for him or not.""

3. It's more likely that Malcolm would be debating whether he feels sorry for Spath, rather than Spath debating whether he feels sorry for himself.

4. The use of ""him"" at the end of the sentence also suggests that ""he"" refers to Malcolm, as it creates a distinction between the person debating (Malcolm) and the person being discussed (Spath).

Based on this analysis, it's most logical that the pronoun ""he"" refers to Malcolm in this context.",1,1
1313,"Violet is a nerdy character who treated Maxime Nerdstrom poorly, so she dumped her in favor of Screech.",she,"0: Violet, 1: Maxime Nerdstrom, 2: Neither","Let's analyze the sentence to determine who ""she"" refers to:

1. The sentence starts with ""Violet is a nerdy character.""
2. It then states that Violet ""treated Maxime Nerdstrom poorly.""
3. The pronoun ""she"" appears in the clause ""so she dumped her.""

Given this information, we can deduce that:
- Violet is the subject of the sentence and the main actor.
- Maxime Nerdstrom is the object of Violet's poor treatment.
- The action of dumping is more likely to be performed by the person who was treated poorly (Maxime Nerdstrom) rather than the person doing the poor treatment (Violet).

Therefore, ""she"" in this context most likely refers to Maxime Nerdstrom, who dumped Violet in response to being treated poorly.",0,1
1314,"Murong Yong personally engaged Murong Chui but was defeated, and he fled back to Zhangzi to try to defend the city.",he,"0: Murong Yong, 1: Murong Chui, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Murong Yong. The context indicates that after Murong Yong was defeated by Murong Chui, ""he"" fled back to Zhangzi to defend the city. This action of fleeing and attempting to defend the city is logically attributed to the defeated party, which is Murong Yong. Murong Chui, being the victor in this engagement, would not be the one fleeing or trying to defend Zhangzi.",0,0
1315,"Raja tries to rape Madhu, but Ajay saves and comforts her.",her,"0: Raja, 1: Madhu, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""her"" clearly refers to Madhu. The context indicates that Raja attempts to rape Madhu, and Ajay saves and comforts ""her"". Given the situation described, ""her"" must be referring to the victim of the attempted rape, which is Madhu. Raja is male (as indicated by the name and the action of attempting rape), so ""her"" cannot refer to Raja. Ajay is also likely male (based on the name and the action of saving), so ""her"" is not referring to Ajay either. Therefore, the pronoun ""her"" unambiguously refers to Madhu.",0,1
1316,Vashuo was killed by Toorima when she betrayed Zion and joined the Cypherites.,she,"0: Vashuo, 1: Toorima, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions two individuals: Vashuo and Toorima.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""when she betrayed Zion and joined the Cypherites.""
3. This action (betraying Zion and joining the Cypherites) is presented as the reason for Vashuo being killed by Toorima.
4. Logically, the person who betrayed Zion and joined the Cypherites must be Toorima, as this action led to her killing Vashuo.
5. Therefore, ""she"" refers to Toorima, not Vashuo.

The pronoun ""she"" clearly refers to Toorima (candidate 1) in this context.",1,1
1317,"The policemen intervene and arrest some demonstrators, although they were not participating in the rally.",they,"0: some demonstrators, 1: The policemen, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and logic of the sentence:

1. The sentence describes two groups: policemen and demonstrators.
2. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the clause ""although they were not participating in the rally.""
3. Logically, it wouldn't make sense for the policemen to not be participating in the rally, as they are described as intervening and arresting demonstrators.
4. The use of ""although"" suggests a contrast between the action of being arrested and not participating in the rally.
5. This contrast only makes sense if ""they"" refers to ""some demonstrators"" who were arrested despite not participating in the rally.

Therefore, the pronoun ""they"" most likely refers to ""some demonstrators"" (candidate 0).",1,0
1318,"Meanwhile, Brumfield was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Alex Preece, after an old football injury forced his evacuation to Australia in mid-November.",his,"0: Lieutenant Colonel Alex Preece, 1: Brumfield, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""his"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions two people: Brumfield and Lieutenant Colonel Alex Preece.
2. The pronoun ""his"" is used in the phrase ""his evacuation to Australia.""
3. The sentence states that Brumfield was replaced by Preece ""after an old football injury forced his evacuation.""

Based on this analysis, it's clear that the ""old football injury"" and subsequent evacuation are referring to Brumfield, not Preece. The sentence is explaining why Brumfield was replaced, which was due to his own injury and evacuation.

Therefore, the pronoun ""his"" refers to Brumfield.",1,1
1319,Ernie Tagg sacked himself as Ali's manager because he felt that a younger manager should take charge of the club.,he,"0: Ernie Tagg, 1: Ali, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Ernie Tagg for the following reasons:

1. Ernie Tagg is the subject of the main clause and the one performing the action of sacking himself.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the subordinate clause to explain Ernie Tagg's reasoning for his action.
3. The sentence is about Ernie Tagg's decision and his feelings, not about Ali.
4. It would not make sense for ""he"" to refer to Ali in this context, as Ali is not the one making the decision or having the feeling described.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" clearly refers to Ernie Tagg (candidate 0).",0,0
1320,"Since Louis is attracted to newcomer Matthew King, he is unable to resist when he starts flirting with him.",he,"0: newcomer Matthew King, 1: Louis, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which 'he' the pronoun refers to. The sentence structure suggests that 'he' refers to Louis for the following reasons:
1. Louis is the subject of the first clause, making him the primary focus.
2. The pronoun 'he' is used in the second clause to continue talking about the same person.
3. The action of 'being unable to resist' logically follows from Louis being attracted to Matthew King.
4. It wouldn't make sense for Matthew King to be flirting with himself.
Therefore, 'he' most likely refers to Louis.",0,1
1321,Brenda is later angry with Tara when she discovers that her adopted daughter Gennie had slept with Bob whilst Viv was in prison.,she,"0: Brenda, 1: Tara, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Brenda is later angry with Tara...""
2. This is followed by ""when she discovers...""

The pronoun ""she"" is most likely referring to Brenda for the following reasons:
- Brenda is the subject of the main clause and is mentioned first in the sentence.
- The sentence is describing Brenda's emotional state (angry) and then explaining why she is angry.
- It makes more sense in the context that Brenda would be the one discovering something about her adopted daughter, as opposed to Tara.

Therefore, ""she"" in this sentence most likely refers to Brenda.",0,0
1322,"However, Keikeya refused to escape with Roslin after the breakout, fearing her break with the military could cause serious fractures within the fleet.",her,"0: Keikeya, 1: Roslin, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""her"" refers to Roslin. The context suggests that Keikeya refused to escape with Roslin, and then mentions ""her break with the military."" This break is more likely to be associated with Roslin, as she is the one who seems to be escaping or breaking away from something. Keikeya is described as refusing to join this action, so ""her"" cannot refer to Keikeya. Therefore, ""her"" most likely refers to Roslin.",0,1
1323,"Losing John is going to be really difficult for Barry, but I think the hardest thing will be losing his son.",his,"0: Barry, 1: John, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""his"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence is about Barry losing John.
2. The pronoun ""his"" is used in the phrase ""losing his son.""
3. Since John is being lost, it's more likely that John is the one with a son, rather than Barry.
4. The sentence structure suggests that ""losing his son"" is an additional consequence of losing John, implying that ""his"" refers to John.

Based on this analysis, it's most logical that ""his"" refers to John, as the sentence is describing the loss of John and the additional loss of John's son.",0,1
1324,"Samuel despises Carl, telling Bandini if he wants to win him over, he has to treat him poorly.",he,"0: Samuel, 1: Carl, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which 'he' the pronoun refers to. The pronoun 'he' appears twice in the sentence. Let's analyze each occurrence:

1. First 'he': '...telling Bandini if he wants to win him over...'
   This 'he' likely refers to Bandini, not Samuel or Carl. It's introducing a new subject in the sentence.

2. Second 'he': '...he has to treat him poorly.'
   This 'he' also likely refers to Bandini, as it's a continuation of the previous clause.

Neither of these instances of 'he' refer to Samuel or Carl. Samuel is the subject of the sentence, and Carl is the object of Samuel's despise. The pronoun 'he' introduces a new person, Bandini, who is being told something by Samuel.

Therefore, the pronoun 'he' in this context doesn't refer to either of the given candidates.",0,2
1325,"The Mughal Emperor Akbar-e-Azam went to the shrine of Ashraf Jahangir Semnani, but on his travels he also felt inspired to see Chishti.",his,"0: Ashraf Jahangir Semnani, 1: The Mughal Emperor Akbar-e-Azam, 2: Neither","The pronoun ""his"" in this context refers to The Mughal Emperor Akbar-e-Azam for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure indicates that Akbar-e-Azam is the main subject of the sentence.
2. The pronoun ""his"" is used in relation to the travels mentioned, which logically belong to the emperor.
3. The sentence describes Akbar-e-Azam's actions and experiences, including his visit to the shrine and his inspiration to see Chishti.
4. Ashraf Jahangir Semnani is mentioned as the owner of the shrine, not as the one traveling or feeling inspired.

Therefore, it is clear that ""his"" refers to The Mughal Emperor Akbar-e-Azam (candidate 1).",1,1
1326,Frank loves Saphir but he complains that he has not yet proposed marriage.,he,"0: Frank, 1: Saphir, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. The pronoun ""he"" is used twice in the sentence.
2. The first ""he"" is the subject of ""complains"".
3. The second ""he"" is the subject of ""has not yet proposed marriage"".
4. Logically, the person who would complain about not proposing marriage would be the one who hasn't proposed yet.
5. In a heterosexual relationship context, it's typically the man who proposes marriage.
6. Frank is presented as the male name in this pair.
7. Therefore, both instances of ""he"" most likely refer to Frank.

Saphir, presumably the female in this context, is the object of Frank's love and the potential recipient of a marriage proposal, not the one doing the complaining or proposing.",1,0
1327,"Sabina is trying to look for Maria, but to no avail, as she worries for her safety.",she,"0: Sabina, 1: Maria, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Sabina is the subject of the main clause and is actively looking for Maria.
2. The pronoun ""she"" appears in the subordinate clause ""as she worries for her safety.""
3. It's more logical that the person doing the searching (Sabina) would be the one worrying about the safety of the person being searched for (Maria).
4. The sentence structure suggests that ""she"" refers back to the subject of the main clause, which is Sabina.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Sabina, who is worrying about Maria's safety while searching for her.",0,0
1328,"Danielle agrees to keep this a secret from Bianca, but she is forced to tell her when she tries to seduce him.",she,"0: Danielle, 1: Bianca, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which 'she' refers to Danielle or Bianca. Let's analyze the sentence:

1. The first 'she' in '...but she is forced to tell her...' likely refers to Danielle because:
   - Danielle is the subject of the first clause and the main actor in the sentence.
   - The action of being 'forced to tell' implies that Danielle is the one who knows the secret and is in the position of having to reveal it.

2. The 'her' in '...tell her...' refers to Bianca, as she is the one being told the secret.

3. The second 'she' in '...when she tries to seduce him' is ambiguous without more context. It could refer to either Danielle or Bianca.

Given that the pronoun we're specifically asked about is the first 'she' in the sentence, which we've determined likely refers to Danielle, we can conclude that the pronoun 'she' refers to Danielle.",1,0
1329,"When Gage became pregnant and attempted to write to Erica after she shipped out, she never responded.",she,"0: Gage, 1: Erica, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, let's analyze the sentence:

1. The sentence mentions two people: Gage and Erica.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""after she shipped out"".
3. The context suggests that one person (Gage) is trying to write to the other person (Erica).
4. The phrase ""shipped out"" typically refers to someone leaving for military service or a long journey.
5. It's more logical that Gage is trying to write to Erica after Erica has shipped out, rather than Gage writing to Erica after Gage herself shipped out.

Based on this analysis, it's most likely that ""she"" refers to Erica, as she is the one who has shipped out and is not responding to Gage's attempts to write to her.",1,1
1330,"Olga has a crush on Tabitha, but unfortunately, she finds her disgusting.",she,"0: Olga, 1: Tabitha, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and meaning of the sentence.

The sentence states that ""Olga has a crush on Tabitha, but unfortunately, she finds her disgusting."" 

The pronoun ""she"" is more likely to refer to Olga for the following reasons:
1. Olga is the subject of the first clause and the main actor in the sentence.
2. It would be more logical for the person with the crush (Olga) to have feelings about the person they have a crush on (Tabitha).
3. The use of ""but unfortunately"" suggests a contrast between Olga's crush and her feelings, implying that Olga is the one finding Tabitha disgusting despite having a crush on her.

It wouldn't make sense for Tabitha to find herself disgusting in this context, so ""she"" is unlikely to refer to Tabitha.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Olga.",1,0
1331,"Smith has occasionally appeared live with Mirza, but he remains an elusive solo permormer.",he,"0: Smith, 1: Mirza, 2: Neither","The pronoun ""he"" in this sentence clearly refers to Smith for the following reasons:

1. Smith is mentioned first in the sentence, making him the primary subject.
2. The sentence structure suggests a contrast between Smith's appearances with Mirza and his solo performances.
3. The phrase ""he remains an elusive solo performer"" logically follows the information about Smith, not Mirza.
4. Grammatically, ""he"" agrees with ""Smith"" (typically a male name) rather than ""Mirza"" (which could be either male or female, but is less likely to be the subject of ""he"" in this context).

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Smith.",0,0
1332,"Sukhoviy confidently challenged Doroshenko, but he was defeated at the battle of Olkhivets by the troops of Petro Doroshenko and Ivan Sirko.",he,"0: Sukhoviy, 1: Doroshenko, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Sukhoviy. The context indicates that Sukhoviy challenged Doroshenko, and then ""he"" (Sukhoviy) was defeated at the battle of Olkhivets. This interpretation makes the most logical sense, as it's describing the outcome of Sukhoviy's challenge to Doroshenko. If ""he"" referred to Doroshenko, it wouldn't make sense in the context of the sentence, as Doroshenko was not the one who initiated the challenge.",1,0
1333,"Young Julia Bing loves Gwendolyne, but she has recently smitten her father a juicy one on the leg for holding up play.",her,"0: Gwendolyne, 1: Young Julia Bing, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. The pronoun ""her"" is used in the phrase ""her father"".
2. The sentence is about Young Julia Bing and her actions.
3. It mentions that she (Julia) has ""smitten her father a juicy one on the leg"".
4. The possessive pronoun ""her"" in this context is referring to the person whose father is mentioned.
5. Logically, this would be Young Julia Bing, not Gwendolyne.

Therefore, ""her"" in this sentence is referring to Young Julia Bing.",0,1

1. The sentence mentions two main individuals: Rick Hauge and Martin.
2. The pronoun ""him"" appears in the phrase ""after he was introduced to him.""
3. The subject of this clause is ""he,"" which likely refers to Rick Hauge, as he is the main subject of the sentence.
4. If ""he"" refers to Rick Hauge, then ""him"" must refer to someone else, which in this case would be Martin.
5. This interpretation makes logical sense: Rick Hauge worked for Martin after being introduced to Martin.

Therefore, the pronoun ""him"" most likely refers to Martin.",0,0
1335,Samantha tries to stop Violet but she and Jamie speed away.,she,"0: Samantha, 1: Violet, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Samantha is trying to stop Violet.
2. ""She and Jamie speed away"" is the action that follows.

Given this information, it's more likely that ""she"" refers to Violet rather than Samantha. The reason is:

- The sentence structure suggests that Samantha's attempt to stop Violet was unsuccessful.
- The action of speeding away with Jamie is more likely to be performed by the person Samantha was trying to stop (Violet) rather than Samantha herself.

Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Violet in this context.",1,1
1336,"Paul falls madly in love with Mike, going insane when he does n't call.",he,"0: Paul, 1: Mike, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""he"" refers to. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""when he doesn't call."" Given the context, it's more likely that Paul is the one waiting for Mike to call, rather than the other way around. This interpretation is supported by the fact that Paul is described as falling ""madly in love"" and ""going insane,"" which suggests he is the one experiencing strong emotions and waiting for contact. Therefore, ""he"" most likely refers to Mike, as Paul is waiting for Mike to call.",1,1
1337,"The committee member expressed appreciation of Dr. Sahib's services, but he recommended that he take a six-month paid leave and then retire.",he,"0: The committee member, 1: Dr. Sahib, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""The committee member"" as the subject performing the action of expressing appreciation.
2. Dr. Sahib is mentioned as the recipient of the appreciation.
3. The pronoun ""he"" appears twice in the latter part of the sentence, both times as the subject of new actions (recommending and taking leave/retiring).
4. It's more logical that the committee member would be making recommendations about Dr. Sahib's career, rather than Dr. Sahib recommending actions for himself.

Given this analysis, it's most likely that both instances of ""he"" refer to the committee member. The committee member is the one recommending that Dr. Sahib take leave and retire. This interpretation maintains a consistent subject throughout the sentence and aligns with the typical role of a committee member in making recommendations about other staff members.",0,0
1338,"Helen thought Sandra was very familiar, but she didn't recognize him.",she,"0: Helen, 1: Sandra, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. The pronoun ""she"" is feminine, so it must refer to either Helen or Sandra, both of which are female names.

2. The sentence structure suggests that ""she"" is the subject of ""didn't recognize him.""

3. The sentence begins with ""Helen thought Sandra was very familiar,"" which sets up Helen as the main subject who is doing the thinking and observing.

4. The use of ""but"" indicates a contrast between the first part of the sentence and the second part. This contrast is between Helen's initial thought of familiarity and the subsequent lack of recognition.

5. It would be illogical for Sandra to not recognize herself, so ""she"" cannot refer to Sandra.

Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Helen, who thought Sandra looked familiar but then didn't recognize him (possibly referring to someone else not mentioned in this sentence).",1,0
1339,"Gabrielle becomes pregnant with a child with Carla, but her miscarriage leads to complications, forcing them to consider adoption.",her,"0: Gabrielle, 1: Carla, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""her"" most likely refers to Gabrielle for the following reasons:

1. Gabrielle is mentioned first in the sentence, making her the primary subject.
2. The sentence structure suggests that Gabrielle is the one who becomes pregnant.
3. The miscarriage is directly linked to ""her,"" which logically follows that it's Gabrielle's pregnancy and miscarriage being discussed.
4. In the context of a same-sex couple (Gabrielle and Carla), typically only one partner would carry the pregnancy, and the sentence indicates that Gabrielle is the one who became pregnant.

While Carla is mentioned, the pronoun ""her"" is more closely associated with Gabrielle's actions and experiences in this sentence.",0,0
1340,"Joanne begins to grow weary of winning Gabrielle back, forcing her to question whether or not she still has feelings for him.",her,"0: Joanne, 1: Gabrielle, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence carefully:

1. Joanne is the subject of the sentence, growing weary of winning Gabrielle back.
2. The pronoun ""her"" is used in the phrase ""forcing her to question"".
3. The pronoun ""her"" is referring to the person who is being forced to question their feelings.
4. Logically, it makes sense that Joanne would be questioning her own feelings, not Gabrielle's.
5. The sentence structure suggests that Joanne is the one experiencing the action (growing weary) and the subsequent effect (questioning feelings).
6. The use of ""him"" at the end of the sentence confirms that Gabrielle is male, so ""her"" cannot refer to Gabrielle.

Therefore, the pronoun ""her"" most likely refers to Joanne.",1,0
1341,"Victor manages to evade Mark, but Elton cannot get away from him.",him,"0: Victor, 1: Mark, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. ""Victor manages to evade Mark"" - This tells us that Victor is getting away from Mark.
2. ""but Elton cannot get away from him"" - The word ""but"" indicates a contrast, suggesting that Elton's situation is different from Victor's.
3. The pronoun ""him"" in this context refers to the person that Elton cannot get away from.
4. Since Victor has already evaded Mark, it's unlikely that ""him"" refers to Victor.
5. The logical conclusion is that ""him"" refers to Mark, as Elton is unable to evade him, in contrast to Victor's successful evasion.

Therefore, the pronoun ""him"" most likely refers to Mark.",0,1
1342,"Victor manages to capture Mark, but Elton gets away from him.",him,"0: Victor, 1: Mark, 2: Neither","Let's analyze the sentence and the pronoun usage:

1. The sentence structure is: ""Victor manages to capture Mark, but Elton gets away from him.""
2. The pronoun ""him"" is used at the end of the sentence.
3. We need to determine who ""him"" refers to.

Looking at the context:
- Victor is the subject of the first clause, performing the action of capturing.
- Mark is the object being captured.
- Elton is introduced in the second clause, getting away from someone.

The most logical interpretation is that Elton is getting away from Victor, not from Mark. This makes sense because:
1. Victor is the active character in the first part of the sentence, establishing him as the main actor.
2. It would be odd for Elton to be getting away from Mark, who has just been captured.

Therefore, ""him"" most likely refers to Victor.",0,0
1343,Darren tries to speak to Leo but Chelsea will not let him in.,him,"0: Darren, 1: Leo, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who the pronoun ""him"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Darren is trying to speak to Leo.
2. Chelsea will not let ""him"" in.

Given this information, it's most logical that ""him"" refers to Darren. The sentence implies that Darren is trying to reach Leo, but Chelsea is preventing Darren from entering or accessing Leo. It wouldn't make sense for Chelsea to prevent Leo from entering, as Leo is not described as trying to go anywhere.

Therefore, ""him"" most likely refers to Darren (candidate 0).",0,0
1344,Sonny supports Simon wholeheartedly until he uses him to his own advantage.,he,"0: Sonny, 1: Simon, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Sonny supports Simon wholeheartedly.""
2. Then it continues with ""until he uses him to his own advantage.""

The pronoun ""he"" in this case is more likely to refer to Simon because:

1. Simon is the object of Sonny's support, which sets up Simon as the focus of the second part of the sentence.
2. The phrase ""uses him"" suggests that the subject (""he"") is acting upon someone else. Since Sonny is the one supporting Simon, it makes more sense that Simon would be the one potentially taking advantage of this support.
3. The structure of the sentence implies a shift in the relationship, where Sonny's support for Simon changes when Simon (he) uses Sonny (him) for his own benefit.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Simon.",1,1
1345,"Nisha refuses to go out with Priya since she needs the money to cure her ailing brother, who is suffering from cancer.",she,"0: Nisha, 1: Priya, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence states that ""Nisha refuses to go out with Priya.""
2. The reason given for this refusal is that ""she needs the money to cure her ailing brother.""

Given this information, it's more logical that the pronoun ""she"" refers to Nisha for the following reasons:

1. Nisha is the subject of the sentence and the one making the decision (refusing to go out).
2. The need for money is presented as the reason for Nisha's refusal, implying that it's Nisha who needs the money.
3. It's more likely that Nisha would be the one needing money to help her own brother, rather than Priya needing money for Nisha's brother.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Nisha.",0,0
1346,"Mary later agrees to a relationship with the married Mandy, but she is only using her to win a bet with her brother Ali.",she,"0: Mary, 1: the married Mandy, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and sentence structure:

1. The sentence starts with ""Mary"" as the subject.
2. The pronoun ""she"" appears later in the sentence.
3. The action associated with ""she"" is ""using her to win a bet.""
4. ""Her"" in this context refers to Mandy.
5. It's more likely that Mary would be using Mandy to win a bet, rather than Mandy using herself.
6. The sentence structure suggests that ""she"" refers back to the subject of the first clause, which is Mary.

Based on these points, it's most logical that ""she"" refers to Mary in this context.",1,0
1347,Church traditionalists would not support elected bishops and so there was no-one to consecrate them.,them,"0: Church traditionalists, 1: elected bishops, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""them"" refers to ""elected bishops"" for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""elected bishops"" is the main subject being discussed.
2. The phrase ""there was no-one to consecrate them"" logically follows the mention of ""elected bishops.""
3. It wouldn't make sense for ""them"" to refer to ""Church traditionalists"" in this context, as they are not the ones being consecrated.
4. The act of consecration is typically performed on bishops, not on traditionalists.

Therefore, ""them"" clearly refers to ""elected bishops"" (candidate 1).",1,1

1. The sentence is about James observing Will Reynold's eyes.
2. The pronoun ""his"" is used in the phrase ""a love of his own.""
3. The sentence is describing a change in Will Reynold's eyes, from anger to love.

Given this context, it's more likely that ""his"" refers to Will Reynold. The sentence is describing Will Reynold's emotional state as observed by James. The phrase ""a love of his own"" suggests that Will Reynold now has love in his eyes, contrasting with the previous anger. It wouldn't make sense for this to refer to James's love, as the sentence is focused on describing the change in Will Reynold's eyes.

Therefore, the pronoun ""his"" most likely refers to Will Reynold.",1,0
1349,"The villagers attempt to have the werewolves executed, but they are instead exiled by the clan leader.",they,"0: the werewolves, 1: The villagers, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" refers to ""the werewolves"" for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure indicates that ""they"" is the subject of the second clause, which is being acted upon (being exiled).

2. The villagers are mentioned as the ones attempting to have someone executed, so they are the actors in the first part of the sentence.

3. It would not make sense for the villagers to attempt to have themselves executed, so ""they"" must refer to a different group.

4. The werewolves are the logical target of the villagers' attempt at execution, and therefore are the ones being exiled instead.

5. Grammatically, ""they"" is a plural pronoun, which matches with the plural noun ""werewolves.""

Therefore, ""they"" most likely refers to ""the werewolves"" in this context.",0,0
1350,"Maria admires Samantha, but she does consider her to be a wacko.",she,"0: Maria, 1: Samantha, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Maria is the subject of the main clause, and Samantha is the object.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the second part of the sentence, which expresses an opinion about someone.
3. The sentence structure suggests that ""she"" (the subject of the second clause) is referring to Maria (the subject of the first clause).
4. It would be more natural for Maria to have an opinion about Samantha, rather than Samantha having an opinion about herself.
5. The use of ""her"" later in the sentence likely refers to Samantha, supporting the idea that ""she"" is Maria.

Based on these points, it's most logical that ""she"" refers to Maria, who is considering Samantha to be a wacko.",1,0
1351,"Hannah feels wooed by Patricia, but she feels challenged by her standing love for Marty.",her,"0: Hannah, 1: Patricia, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""her"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Hannah is the subject of the first clause.
2. Patricia is mentioned as the person wooing Hannah.
3. The pronoun ""she"" in the second clause likely refers back to Hannah, as she is the main subject of the sentence.
4. The phrase ""her standing love for Marty"" is part of what Hannah feels challenged by.

Given this analysis, ""her"" in ""her standing love for Marty"" most likely refers to Hannah. It wouldn't make sense for Patricia to have a standing love for Marty in this context, as the sentence is describing Hannah's feelings and challenges.

1. Christopher had tried to stop Paul from acting out.
2. Then, ""he eventually calmed down.""

The pronoun ""he"" is more likely to refer to Paul for the following reasons:

1. Paul was the one who was initially acting out, implying he was in an agitated state.
2. Christopher was trying to stop Paul, suggesting Christopher was already calm.
3. The use of ""eventually"" implies that there was a process of calming down, which aligns more with Paul's initial state of agitation.
4. It's more logical for the person who was acting out (Paul) to be the one who needed to calm down, rather than the person trying to stop the behavior (Christopher).

1354,"Baker was only slightly less conservative than Holloway, but Democratic voters apparently saw him as the lesser of two evils.",him,"0: Baker, 1: Holloway, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""him"" clearly refers to Baker. The context suggests that Democratic voters saw Baker as ""the lesser of two evils"" when compared to Holloway.

1355,Ebony then becomes overprotective of Jay when Amber admits to falling for him.,him,"0: Ebony, 1: Jay, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""him"" clearly refers to Jay. The context indicates that Amber admits to falling for someone, and that someone is referred to as ""him."" Given the candidates provided, Jay is the only male individual mentioned, making him the logical referent for the pronoun ""him."" Ebony is likely female (based on the name), and therefore wouldn't be referred to as ""him."" The sentence structure and meaning also support this interpretation, as it makes sense that Ebony would become overprotective of Jay when learning about Amber's feelings for him.",1,1
1356,Nadine breaks up with Nicole when she realizes how deceptive she is.,she,"0: Nadine, 1: Nicole, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""she"" the pronoun refers to. The sentence structure suggests that ""she"" is referring to Nicole, not Nadine. Here's why:

1. The sentence starts with ""Nadine breaks up with Nicole,"" establishing Nadine as the subject and Nicole as the object.
2. The pronoun ""she"" appears twice in the latter part of the sentence: ""when she realizes how deceptive she is.""
3. The first ""she"" likely refers to Nadine, as she is the one realizing something.
4. The second ""she"" is described as ""deceptive,"" which is the reason for the breakup.
5. It makes more logical sense that Nadine is breaking up with Nicole because Nicole is deceptive, rather than Nadine breaking up with Nicole because Nadine herself is deceptive.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" in the question most likely refers to Nicole, as she is the one being described as deceptive and the reason for the breakup.",0,"1

1357,"Pamela wants to escape when Mrs. Jewkes is away, but she is terrified by two nearby cows that she thinks are bulls.",she,"0: Pamela, 1: Mrs. Jewkes, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""she"" refers to: Pamela or Mrs. Jewkes. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Pamela wants to escape,"" indicating that Pamela is the main subject.
2. The clause ""when Mrs. Jewkes is away"" provides additional information about the timing of Pamela's escape plan.
3. The pronoun ""she"" appears in the second part of the sentence: ""but she is terrified by two nearby cows.""
4. The fear of cows (mistaken for bulls) is more likely to be associated with Pamela, who is trying to escape, rather than Mrs. Jewkes, who is mentioned as being away.

Given this analysis, it's clear that ""she"" refers to Pamela, as she is the one who wants to escape and is likely to be terrified by the cows she mistakes for bulls.",0,0
1358,Amelia becomes obsessed with Beatrice but she quickly becomes hurt and angry as she never calls her.,she,"0: Amelia, 1: Beatrice, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. ""Amelia becomes obsessed with Beatrice"" - This establishes the two characters in the sentence.
2. ""but she quickly becomes hurt and angry"" - This is where we need to determine who ""she"" refers to.
3. ""as she never calls her"" - This provides additional context.

The pronoun ""she"" in this sentence is most likely referring to Amelia for the following reasons:
- Amelia is the subject of the first clause and the main actor in the sentence.
- The sentence describes someone becoming ""hurt and angry"" which aligns with the person who is obsessed (Amelia) rather than the object of obsession (Beatrice).
- The last part ""as she never calls her"" implies that ""she"" (Beatrice) is not calling ""her"" (Amelia), which further supports that the ""she"" who is hurt and angry is Amelia.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" in this context most likely refers to Amelia.",1,0
1359,"Tony attempts to comfort Jake, but he seems more absorbed in memories evoked by his own mementos.",his,"0: Tony, 1: Jake, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""his"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence describes Tony attempting to comfort Jake.
2. The pronoun ""his"" is used in the phrase ""his own mementos.""
3. The sentence states that ""he seems more absorbed in memories evoked by his own mementos.""

Given this information, it's more likely that ""his"" refers to Tony rather than Jake. The sentence structure suggests that Tony is the one who is absorbed in memories related to his own mementos, despite his attempt to comfort Jake. This interpretation makes more sense in the context of the sentence, as it explains why Tony's attempt to comfort Jake might not be fully effective.",0,0
1360,"Nancy madly pursues Lorraine, although she is known not to like her in return.",she,"0: Nancy, 1: Lorraine, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Nancy is pursuing Lorraine.
2. ""she"" is known not to like ""her"" in return.

The pronoun ""she"" is more likely to refer to Lorraine because:
- It's more natural to say that the person being pursued (Lorraine) doesn't like the pursuer (Nancy) in return.
- If ""she"" referred to Nancy, it would mean Nancy doesn't like herself in return, which doesn't make sense in this context.

Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Lorraine, who is known not to like Nancy in return.",1,1
1361,"Kai was hired again by Ron later, but he got fired again for slacking off.",he,"0: Kai, 1: Ron, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, let's analyze the sentence:

""Kai was hired again by Ron later, but he got fired again for slacking off.""

The pronoun ""he"" is most likely referring to Kai for the following reasons:

1. Kai is the subject of the first clause and the main focus of the sentence.
2. The sentence structure suggests that the same person who was hired is the one who got fired.
3. The phrase ""got fired again"" implies that this person has been fired before, which aligns with Kai being hired ""again.""
4. It's more logical that an employee (Kai) would be fired for slacking off rather than the employer (Ron).

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Kai.",1,0
1362,"Ann seems more interested in dating Maxine at first, but she rejects her as soon as he begins to become successful.",her,"0: Ann, 1: Maxine, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. ""Ann seems more interested in dating Maxine at first"" - This establishes Ann as the subject and Maxine as the object of Ann's interest.

2. ""but she rejects her"" - Here, we have two pronouns: ""she"" and ""her"". 
   - ""she"" likely refers to Ann, as Ann is the subject of the sentence.
   - ""her"" is the object of the rejection, which logically would be Maxine.

3. ""as soon as he begins to become successful"" - The introduction of ""he"" suggests there's a male character not explicitly named in the given text. This ""he"" is likely the reason for the rejection.

Given that the pronoun we're asked about is ""her"", and based on the analysis above, ""her"" most likely refers to Maxine. Ann (she) is rejecting Maxine (her).",1,1
1363,"Raja is ultimately proved innocent while Chinnoy Seth is convicted after he blurts out the truth in court, thanks to Ravi.",he,"0: Raja, 1: Chinnoy Seth, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Chinnoy Seth. The context indicates that someone ""blurts out the truth in court,"" which leads to their conviction. Since Raja is mentioned as being ""proved innocent,"" it's clear that he is not the one who blurted out the truth. Therefore, ""he"" must refer to Chinnoy Seth, who is described as being convicted after this action.",1,1
1364,"Tanya finally catches up with Laurana, but before she can say much to her Kitiara arrives.",she,"0: Tanya, 1: Laurana, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Tanya catches up with Laurana.
2. Before ""she"" can say much to ""her"" (Laurana), Kitiara arrives.

The pronoun ""she"" is most likely referring to Tanya because:
- Tanya is the subject of the first part of the sentence (she catches up with Laurana).
- The action of wanting to say something to Laurana logically follows Tanya catching up with her.
- ""She"" and ""her"" in the second part of the sentence are different people, and we know ""her"" refers to Laurana, so ""she"" must be Tanya.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Tanya (candidate 0).",0,0
1365,"Max attracts the attention of a senior bachelor, Mr Conroy, but he is not interested.",he,"0: Max, 1: a senior bachelor , Mr Conroy, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence introduces two characters: Max and Mr Conroy.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the latter part of the sentence.
3. The sentence states that ""he is not interested.""

Given the context, it's more likely that ""he"" refers to Mr Conroy for the following reasons:
1. The sentence is about Max attracting Mr Conroy's attention.
2. It would be more natural to say that Mr Conroy is not interested in Max, rather than Max not being interested in attracting attention.
3. If ""he"" referred to Max, the sentence would be somewhat contradictory (Max attracts attention but is not interested in doing so).

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Mr Conroy, the senior bachelor.",0,1
1366,"Max attracts the attention of a senior bachelor, Mr Conroy, but he has led a sheltered life and is too shy to allow the romance to develop.",he,"0: Max, 1: a senior bachelor , Mr Conroy, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and grammatical structure of the sentence.

1. The sentence introduces two male characters: Max and Mr Conroy.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the latter part of the sentence.
3. The clause ""he has led a sheltered life"" provides additional information about one of the characters.
4. The sentence structure suggests that this information is about Max, not Mr Conroy.
5. It would be more logical for Max, as the main subject of the sentence, to be described as shy and leading a sheltered life, rather than the senior bachelor Mr Conroy.

Based on these observations, it is most likely that ""he"" refers to Max.",0,0
1367,Historian Megan was convinced that Bilqis could not have been fully human because she had a throne and led people.,she,"0: Bilqis, 1: Historian Megan, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions two female individuals: Historian Megan and Bilqis.
2. The pronoun ""she"" appears in the latter part of the sentence, referring to someone who ""had a throne and led people.""
3. The sentence is about Historian Megan's belief about Bilqis.
4. The attributes of having a throne and leading people are associated with Bilqis, not Historian Megan.

Based on this analysis, it's clear that the pronoun ""she"" refers to Bilqis. The sentence is explaining Historian Megan's belief about Bilqis, and the attributes mentioned (having a throne and leading people) are clearly associated with Bilqis, not Historian Megan.",1,0
1368,"Jigsaw was looking for a rematch with Sweeney, but he was more interested in the bigger Chikara names, such as Chris Hero and Mike Quackenbush.",he,"0: Jigsaw, 1: Sweeney, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Sweeney, not Jigsaw. The context suggests that Jigsaw was seeking a rematch with Sweeney, but Sweeney (referred to as ""he"") was more interested in facing other wrestlers from Chikara. This interpretation makes sense because:

1. The sentence starts with Jigsaw as the subject, looking for a rematch with Sweeney.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is then used to refer to a different person than the subject of the first clause.
3. The interest in facing bigger Chikara names is more likely to be attributed to Sweeney, as he is the one being challenged for a rematch and might prefer other opponents.

Therefore, ""he"" in this context refers to Sweeney (candidate 1).",0,1
1369,"Sweeney was pinned by Jigsaw, after his stable mate Spyrazul turned on him and then unmasked himself as Quackenbush.",his,"0: Sweeney, 1: Jigsaw, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""his"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions three characters: Sweeney, Jigsaw, and Spyrazul.
2. The pronoun ""his"" is used in the phrase ""his stable mate Spyrazul.""
3. The term ""stable mate"" implies a close association or partnership in wrestling.
4. The sentence structure suggests that Spyrazul turned on someone, and that someone is referred to as ""him.""
5. The most logical interpretation is that Spyrazul turned on Sweeney, as Sweeney is mentioned first and is the subject of being pinned by Jigsaw.

Given this analysis, it's most likely that ""his"" refers to Sweeney. Sweeney appears to be the main subject of the sentence, and it makes sense that Spyrazul would be described as Sweeney's stable mate before turning on him.",1,0
1370,"Layla initially thinks Carolyn is stuck up, especially when she disagrees with his idea for Harold's buck's night.",she,"0: Layla, 1: Carolyn, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun 'she' refers to Carolyn. We can determine this because the sentence states that Carolyn 'disagrees with his idea for Harold's buck's night.' The pronoun 'she' is used to refer to the person doing the disagreeing, which is Carolyn. Layla is mentioned at the beginning of the sentence as the one who 'initially thinks,' but she is not the subject of the clause containing the pronoun 'she.'",1,1
1371,Wanda ends up yelling at Molly when she doesnt give her any information.,she,"0: Wanda, 1: Molly, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""she"" refers to: Wanda or Molly. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Wanda ends up yelling at Molly.""
2. Then it continues with ""when she doesn't give her any information.""

The pronoun ""she"" in this case is more likely to refer to Molly because:
1. Molly is the object of the first part of the sentence (Wanda is yelling at Molly).
2. The second part of the sentence provides the reason for Wanda's action (yelling), which is that ""she"" (Molly) doesn't give ""her"" (Wanda) any information.

It makes more sense that Wanda is yelling at Molly because Molly isn't giving Wanda information, rather than Wanda yelling at Molly because Wanda herself isn't giving information.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" in this context most likely refers to Molly.",1,1
1372,"Karla tries to distance himself from Sarah, but she falls for her.",she,"0: Karla, 1: Sarah, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. ""Karla tries to distance himself from Sarah"" - This part introduces two characters, Karla and Sarah.

2. ""but she falls for her"" - Here we have two pronouns: ""she"" and ""her"".

3. The pronoun we're asked about is ""she"".

4. Given the context, ""she"" is more likely to refer to Sarah for the following reasons:
   - Karla is referred to as ""himself"" earlier in the sentence, suggesting Karla is male.
   - The sentence structure implies a contrast between Karla's action (distancing) and someone else's reaction (falling for).
   - It's more logical that Sarah would be the one falling for Karla, given that Karla is trying to distance himself.

5. Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Sarah in this context.",1,1
1373,Heather helps Summer when she is bullied on her paper round by Jacinta Martin.,she,"0: Summer, 1: Heather, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, let's analyze the sentence:

""Heather helps Summer when she is bullied on her paper round by Jacinta Martin.""

The pronoun ""she"" in this sentence is most likely referring to Summer for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure suggests that Heather is helping Summer in a specific situation.
2. The situation described is that ""she is bullied on her paper round,"" which implies that the person being bullied is the one who has a paper round.
3. It's more logical that Summer, as the person being helped, is the one experiencing bullying rather than Heather, who is providing the help.
4. The sentence flows more naturally if ""she"" refers to Summer, as it maintains a clear subject (Summer) who is receiving help and experiencing bullying.

Therefore, based on the context and logical flow of the sentence, ""she"" most likely refers to Summer.",1,0
1374,Deverill reveals to Carl that when he was alive he buried a small treasure in the floorboards of a house in town.,he,"0: Deverill, 1: Carl, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Deverill for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure indicates that Deverill is the subject who is revealing information to Carl.
2. The clause ""when he was alive"" suggests that the person being referred to is no longer alive, which contextually fits with Deverill (who is revealing information about his past).
3. The action of burying treasure is linked to the subject of the sentence (Deverill) rather than the object (Carl).

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Deverill.",0,0
1375,"Laney reconciles with Amy, but she starts avoiding her and eventually reveals that she has been seeing Damien and that she is pregnant.",she,"0: Laney, 1: Amy, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Laney reconciles with Amy"", establishing both Laney and Amy as subjects.
2. The pronoun ""she"" appears twice in the sentence:
   - ""she starts avoiding her""
   - ""she has been seeing Damien and that she is pregnant""

In both cases, ""she"" seems to refer to the same person. The key information is that this person has been seeing Damien and is pregnant. This is new information that is being revealed about one of the characters.

Given the structure of the sentence, it's more likely that Laney is the one revealing this information about herself to Amy. The sentence implies that after reconciling, Laney starts avoiding Amy and then reveals why - because she (Laney) has been seeing Damien and is pregnant.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Laney.",1,0
1376,Hannah begins seeing Laney Wilkinson but she ends the relationship when she brags about how far she has really gone with her.,she,"0: Hannah, 1: Laney Wilkinson, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Hannah begins seeing Laney Wilkinson""
2. Then it says ""but she ends the relationship""
3. Finally, it mentions ""when she brags about how far she has really gone with her""

The first ""she"" in the sentence is likely referring to Hannah because:
1. Hannah is the subject of the first clause and the main actor in the sentence.
2. It's more logical that Hannah would end the relationship, as she is the one who ""begins seeing"" Laney.

The second and third ""she"" instances seem to refer to Laney Wilkinson because:
1. It makes more sense that Laney would be the one bragging about her experiences.
2. The phrase ""how far she has really gone with her"" implies that Laney is talking about her experiences with Hannah.

Since the question asks about the first instance of ""she"" in the sentence, the most likely referent is Hannah.",1,
1377,"Bob takes an interest in Billy, but he realises that he is not over Anne and he quickly backs off.",he,"0: Billy, 1: Bob, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. ""Bob takes an interest in Billy"" - This establishes Bob as the active subject.
2. ""but he realises"" - This 'he' is more likely to refer to Bob, as he's the one taking action (realizing something).
3. ""that he is not over Anne"" - This 'he' is also more likely to be Bob. It's unlikely that Bob would realize something about Billy's feelings for Anne.
4. ""and he quickly backs off"" - Again, this action of backing off is more consistent with Bob's behavior, given that he's the one who initially took interest and then realized something.

Throughout the sentence, the pronoun 'he' consistently refers to Bob. Bob is the one taking actions: taking interest, realizing, and backing off. The sentence is describing Bob's thoughts and actions in relation to Billy and Anne.",0,1
1378,"Andrew asks Louis whether he knows any wererats who would be willing to participate in an interview with Elvira, and Louis offers to ask around.",he,"0: Andrew, 1: Louis, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Louis. We can determine this because:

1. Andrew is asking Louis a question about knowing wererats.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the context of knowing wererats.
3. Louis is the one who responds by offering to ask around, indicating that he is the one who might know wererats or have connections to them.

Therefore, ""he"" in this context refers to Louis, not Andrew.",1,1
1379,"Carol tries to keep a weakened Serena awake, but she is unable to and she vanishes into the rough seas.",she,"0: Carol, 1: a weakened Serena, 2: Neither","In this sentence, there are two instances of the pronoun ""she"". Let's analyze them separately:

1. ""...but she is unable to"": This ""she"" refers to Carol. The context suggests that Carol is trying to keep Serena awake, but Carol is unable to do so.

2. ""...and she vanishes into the rough seas"": This ""she"" refers to Serena. It's Serena who is weakened and presumably vanishes into the seas.

Since the question asks about which candidate the pronoun refers to, and doesn't specify which instance of ""she"" to focus on, we need to consider both. In this case, the pronoun ""she"" is used to refer to both Carol and Serena in different parts of the sentence.

Given that the pronoun refers to both candidates at different points, and there's no clear indication of which instance we should prioritize, the most appropriate answer would be that neither candidate exclusively is the referent of ""she"" throughout the entire sentence.",1,2
1380,Henry leaves Charles but he runs after him and tells him that Madge has changed her mind and he moves in with them.,him,"0: Charles, 1: Henry, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. ""Henry leaves Charles"" - This establishes Henry as the subject and Charles as the object.
2. ""but he runs after him"" - Here, ""he"" likely refers to Charles (as Henry was leaving, it makes more sense for Charles to run after Henry).
3. ""and tells him"" - This ""him"" is the pronoun we're focusing on. Since Charles is the one running after someone, it's logical that he's telling something to the person he's running after, which is Henry.
4. ""that Madge has changed her mind and he moves in with them"" - This additional information doesn't change our interpretation of the specific ""him"" we're analyzing.

Therefore, the pronoun ""him"" in this context refers to Henry, as Charles is running after Henry and telling Henry something.",1,1
1381,Lyndon first felt attracted to Harry when he showed off how big his pants were.,he,"0: Lyndon, 1: Harry, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Lyndon first felt attracted to Harry"".
2. This is followed by ""when he showed off how big his pants were"".

The pronoun ""he"" in this context is more likely to refer to Harry for the following reasons:
1. Harry is the object of Lyndon's attraction, making him the focus of the action.
2. It's more logical that Lyndon would be attracted to Harry when Harry showed off his pants, rather than Lyndon being attracted to Harry when Lyndon himself showed off his own pants.
3. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" refers to the most recently mentioned person, which is Harry.

Therefore, based on the context and sentence structure, ""he"" most likely refers to Harry.",0,1
1382,Lyndon first felt attracted to Harry when he learned how big his pants were.,he,"0: Lyndon, 1: Harry, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Lyndon first felt attracted to Harry...""
2. The pronoun ""he"" appears in the clause ""...when he learned how big his pants were.""
3. Logically, Lyndon is the subject who is feeling the attraction, so it makes sense that Lyndon would be the one learning about Harry's pants.
4. It's unlikely that Harry would be learning about his own pants in this context.
5. The pronoun ""he"" is more likely to refer to the subject of the main clause (Lyndon) rather than the object (Harry).

Based on this analysis, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Lyndon.",0,0
1383,"Matilda tries to flirt with Dee Bliss, but she is not impressed when she learns he is only nineteen.",she,"0: Matilda, 1: Dee Bliss, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. ""Matilda tries to flirt with Dee Bliss"" - This establishes that Matilda is doing the flirting and Dee Bliss is the target of the flirtation.

2. ""but she is not impressed"" - Here, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Given the context, it's more likely that Dee Bliss is the one who is not impressed, as she is the recipient of the flirtation.

3. ""when she learns he is only nineteen"" - This further confirms that ""she"" refers to Dee Bliss, as Dee is the one learning about Matilda's age. The use of ""he"" here refers back to Matilda, indicating that Matilda is male.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" in this sentence refers to Dee Bliss, not Matilda.",1,1
1384,Jane was offered the role of Pam after she attended a screen test.,she,"0: Jane, 1: Pam, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" refers to Jane. The sentence structure indicates that Jane is the subject who was offered the role and who attended the screen test. The pronoun ""she"" is used to avoid repeating Jane's name in the second part of the sentence. Pam is mentioned as the role that was offered to Jane, not as the person who attended the screen test.",1,0
1385,"Stuart began to grow suspicious of Samuel again when he found out that his friend, Trent Hoffa was hit by a car.",he,"0: Stuart, 1: Samuel, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Stuart began to grow suspicious of Samuel again...""
2. The pronoun ""he"" appears in the phrase ""when he found out...""
3. Logically, the person who ""found out"" about the incident is more likely to be Stuart, as he is the one growing suspicious.
4. The sentence is describing Stuart's actions and thoughts, making him the most likely subject of the pronoun ""he.""
5. Samuel is mentioned as the object of Stuart's suspicion, not as the one finding out information.

Based on this analysis, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Stuart.",0,0
1386,"Pringle tried to arrange to have Prince manumited, so he would have illegal freedom.",he,"0: Pringle, 1: Prince, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Pringle is the subject of the sentence, performing the action of trying to arrange something.
2. Prince is the object of the action, the one who would be manumitted (freed from slavery).
3. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""he would have illegal freedom.""

Given this context, it's clear that ""he"" refers to Prince, not Pringle. The sentence is explaining that Pringle was trying to arrange for Prince to be manumitted, which would result in Prince having illegal freedom. It wouldn't make sense for Pringle to arrange his own manumission or for Pringle to have illegal freedom as a result of manumitting Prince.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Prince.",0,1
1387,"Dan walks away from Samuel and he tries running after him, but he trips and falls.",him,"0: Dan, 1: Samuel, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. ""Dan walks away from Samuel"" - This establishes the initial action and positions of the two characters.

2. ""and he tries running after him"" - Here, we have two pronouns: ""he"" and ""him"". 
   - ""he"" refers to the person doing the running, which is logically Samuel, as Dan is walking away.
   - ""him"" refers to the person being run after, which must be Dan.

3. ""but he trips and falls"" - This ""he"" refers to the same person as the previous ""he"", which we determined to be Samuel.

The pronoun we're specifically asked about is ""him"". As we've established, in this context, ""him"" refers to Dan, the person being run after.

Therefore, the pronoun ""him"" refers to Dan, which is candidate 0.",0,0
1388,"Susan has doubts about employing Gemma Reeves, but Toadie persuades her to give his cousin a chance.",her,"0: Susan, 1: Gemma Reeves, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who the pronoun ""her"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Susan is mentioned first and is the subject of the sentence.
2. Gemma Reeves is mentioned second and is the object of Susan's doubts about employment.
3. Toadie is mentioned, but he's not a candidate for the pronoun ""her"" as he's referred to as ""his.""

The pronoun ""her"" is used in the phrase ""give his cousin a chance."" This implies that someone is being given a chance. Given the context, it's clear that Gemma Reeves is the one being given a chance, as she's the one Susan has doubts about employing.

Therefore, ""her"" refers to Gemma Reeves, not Susan.",0,1
1389,"Since the linesmen are relatively far away from the referees, they are also responsible for observing the sidelines on their side of the field.",they,"0: the linesmen, 1: the referees, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" refers to ""the linesmen"" for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure places ""the linesmen"" as the subject of the main clause.
2. The pronoun ""they"" is used to continue discussing the responsibilities of the linesmen.
3. The phrase ""are also responsible"" indicates that additional information about the linesmen's duties is being provided.
4. The context of the sentence focuses on the linesmen's role and their position relative to the referees.

While the referees are mentioned, they are used as a reference point for the linesmen's position rather than being the subject of the sentence or the focus of the pronoun ""they"".",1,0
1390,"Nancy wants to win Lupita back, but she rejects her for Santos.",she,"0: Nancy, 1: Lupita, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Nancy is the subject of the first clause, wanting to win Lupita back.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is the subject of the second clause, rejecting ""her"" for Santos.

Given this information, it's more likely that ""she"" refers to Lupita rather than Nancy. This is because:

1. If ""she"" referred to Nancy, it would mean Nancy is rejecting herself, which doesn't make sense in this context.
2. The sentence structure suggests a contrast between Nancy's desire and Lupita's action.
3. It's more logical that Lupita is the one rejecting Nancy (referred to as ""her"") for Santos.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Lupita.",1,1
1391,"Mr. Grinder arrives looking for Carboy, but no one will help him.",him,"0: Mr. Grinder, 1: Carboy, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""him"" refers to Mr. Grinder. The sentence structure indicates that Mr. Grinder is the one arriving and looking for Carboy. The phrase ""no one will help him"" logically refers back to Mr. Grinder, as he is the active subject of the sentence who is seeking assistance. It wouldn't make sense for ""him"" to refer to Carboy in this context, as Carboy is the person being sought, not the one seeking help.",0,0
1392,Karl is angry with Todd but he assures him he will always visit him and Annette.,he,"0: Karl, 1: Todd, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""he"" the pronoun refers to. Let's break it down:

1. ""Karl is angry with Todd"" - This establishes the two main characters in the sentence.
2. ""but he assures him"" - This is where the first ""he"" appears. 

The use of ""but"" suggests a contrast to the previous statement. Since Karl is the one who is angry, it would make more sense for Todd to be the one assuring Karl, rather than Karl assuring Todd while being angry.

3. ""he will always visit him and Annette"" - This further supports that Todd is the one doing the assuring, as he's promising to visit Karl (and Annette, who is likely associated with Karl).

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Todd in this context.",1,1
1393,Ned moved in with Stephan when he was forced out of his home by his new housemates.,he,"0: Ned, 1: Stephan, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence starts with ""Ned moved in with Stephan.""
2. This is followed by ""when he was forced out of his home.""
3. The pronoun ""he"" is more likely to refer to the subject of the main clause, which is Ned.
4. It makes more sense contextually that Ned was forced out of his home, which led to him moving in with Stephan.
5. If ""he"" referred to Stephan, the sentence would imply that Stephan was forced out of his home, but Ned moved in with him, which is less logical.

Based on this analysis, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Ned.",0,0
1394,Tanya then discusses with Dr. Melfi and asks if she can find her a suitable therapist.,she,"0: Tanya, 1: Dr. Melfi, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""she"" refers to: Tanya or Dr. Melfi. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the context of finding a suitable therapist. Given that Tanya is the subject of the sentence and is discussing with Dr. Melfi, it's more logical that Tanya would be the one asking for help in finding a therapist. It wouldn't make sense for Dr. Melfi, who is presumably already a therapist, to be asking for another therapist. Therefore, ""she"" in this context refers to Tanya.",1,0
1395,"Furthermore, Prem is in love with Max but he believes that he isn't worthy of him.",he,"0: Prem, 1: Max, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""he"" the pronoun refers to. Let's break it down:

1. ""Prem is in love with Max"" - This establishes the relationship between Prem and Max.
2. ""but he believes"" - This is the first use of ""he"" we need to resolve.
3. ""that he isn't worthy of him"" - This contains two more pronouns: another ""he"" and ""him"".

The key to resolving this is understanding the logic of the sentence. The person who ""believes"" is likely the one who is in love, which is Prem. The one who ""isn't worthy"" is also likely to be the person in love (Prem), and the one he isn't worthy of would be the object of his love (Max).

Therefore, the first ""he"" in the sentence (the one we're asked about) refers to Prem. He (Prem) believes that he (Prem) isn't worthy of him (Max).",0,0
1396,"Peavy was hired by Taylor after he dismissed his previous butler, Edward F. Sands, for forging his signature on checks.",he,"0: Peavy, 1: Taylor, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Peavy was hired by Taylor...""
2. This is followed by ""after he dismissed his previous butler...""

The pronoun ""he"" is more likely to refer to Taylor because:
a) Taylor is the subject of the action ""dismissed""
b) It makes more sense contextually that Taylor, as the employer, would dismiss his previous butler
c) Peavy is introduced as being hired, so he wouldn't be the one dismissing a previous butler

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Taylor.",1,1
1397,"Priya tries to impress Annie, but she prefers the handsome Hurst and promises to come to him that night.",she,"0: Annie, 1: Priya, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Priya is trying to impress Annie.
2. ""She"" prefers the handsome Hurst.
3. ""She"" promises to come to Hurst that night.

Given this information, it's clear that ""she"" refers to Annie, not Priya. The reasons are:

1. Priya is the one doing the impressing, so she's not the one being referred to by ""she.""
2. The sentence structure indicates that ""she"" is the object of Priya's attempts to impress, which is Annie.
3. ""She"" is making a decision (preferring Hurst) and a promise (to come to him), which suggests this is Annie's response to Priya's attempts to impress her.

Therefore, ""she"" in this context refers to Annie.",0,0
1398,The juvenile courts had jurisdiction over the defendants until they were twenty-one.,they,"0: The juvenile courts, 1: the defendants, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. ""The juvenile courts"" is the subject of the sentence and is singular.
2. ""The defendants"" is plural and matches the pronoun ""they"" in number.
3. The verb ""were"" is used with ""they,"" which is a plural verb form.
4. Logically, it makes more sense for the age limit (twenty-one) to apply to the defendants rather than the courts.

Based on these observations, ""they"" most likely refers to ""the defendants"" because:
- It matches in number (plural).
- It's logical for defendants to have an age limit in juvenile court jurisdiction.
- The sentence structure suggests that ""they"" refers to the object (defendants) rather than the subject (courts).

Therefore, the pronoun ""they"" refers to ""the defendants.""",1,1
1399,Reimers was a bitter rival of Tycho Brahe after he tried to claim the Tychonic system as his own.,he,"0: Reimers, 1: Tycho Brahe, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Reimers. The sentence structure indicates that Reimers was the one who tried to claim the Tychonic system as his own, which led to him becoming a bitter rival of Tycho Brahe. The pronoun ""he"" is used to avoid repeating Reimers' name in the same sentence.",0,0
1400,"Brie is worried about leaving Ruth, but she assures her she needs to get to know Geoff.",she,"0: Brie, 1: Ruth, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""she"" the pronoun refers to. There are two instances of ""she"" in the sentence, and we need to analyze the context to determine which one refers to which person.

The first ""she"" in the sentence is the subject of the verb ""assures."" This action of assuring is more likely to be performed by Brie, who is worried about leaving Ruth. It makes sense that Brie would be the one assuring Ruth, not the other way around.

The second ""she"" is the object of the verb ""assures"" and is referred to as ""her."" This is likely Ruth, as she is the one being assured by Brie.

Therefore, the first ""she"" in the sentence, which is the pronoun we're asked about, refers to Brie.",1,0
1401,"Mark finally agrees to kill Serge, but he says that this will be the last order he will carry out.",he,"0: Mark, 1: Serge, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""he"" refers to. The sentence structure and context provide clues:

1. The first part of the sentence states ""Mark finally agrees to kill Serge.""
2. The second part, connected by ""but,"" says ""he says that this will be the last order he will carry out.""

The pronoun ""he"" is more likely to refer to Mark because:
a) Mark is the subject of the first clause and the main actor in the sentence.
b) The statement about carrying out an order implies that Mark is the one following orders, not Serge.
c) It would make more sense for Mark to declare this as his last order, given that he's the one agreeing to kill Serge.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Mark.",0,0
1402,"Daniel later married accountant Colin Burke, but he was later arrested for fraud and jailed.",he,"0: Daniel, 1: accountant Colin Burke, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence introduces two male individuals: Daniel and Colin Burke.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used later in the sentence to refer to one of these individuals.
3. The key information is that the person referred to by ""he"" was ""arrested for fraud and jailed.""
4. Given the sentence structure, it's more likely that this information relates to the most recently mentioned person, which is Colin Burke.
5. It would be somewhat unusual to introduce Colin Burke and then immediately switch back to talking about Daniel without a clear indication.

Based on this analysis, it's most probable that ""he"" refers to Colin Burke, the accountant who Daniel married.",1,1
1403,"Duncan smugly asides to Lance that if he loses, he will give him a two-week Hawaiian vacation.",he,"0: Duncan, 1: Lance, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""he"" refers to: Duncan or Lance. Let's analyze the context:

1. Duncan is the subject of the sentence, performing the action of speaking to Lance.
2. The pronoun ""he"" appears in the conditional clause ""if he loses.""
3. The sentence structure suggests that Duncan is making a statement about a potential future event.
4. It would make more sense for Duncan to offer Lance a vacation if Lance loses, rather than offering Lance a vacation if Duncan himself loses.

Given this reasoning, it's more logical that ""he"" refers to Lance. Duncan is making a smug comment about giving Lance a vacation if Lance loses.",0,1
1404,"Elaine locates Mrs. Peterman, but she refuses to approve her purchases without seeing the hat.",she,"0: Elaine, 1: Peterman, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" refers to Mrs. Peterman, not Elaine. This can be determined from the context of the sentence:

1. Elaine is the subject of the first part of the sentence, performing the action of locating Mrs. Peterman.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the second part of the sentence, referring to the person who ""refuses to approve her purchases.""
3. It wouldn't make sense for Elaine to refuse to approve her own purchases, so ""she"" must refer to Mrs. Peterman.
4. The use of ""her"" later in the sentence (referring to Elaine's purchases) further confirms that ""she"" is not Elaine, but Mrs. Peterman.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" refers to Mrs. Peterman, which is candidate 1.",1,1
1405,"Singer Cher was originally cast as Mona Mondieu, but she backed out at the last minute.",she,"0: Singer Cher, 1: Mona Mondieu, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" clearly refers to Singer Cher. The sentence states that Cher was originally cast as Mona Mondieu, but then ""she"" (referring back to Cher) backed out at the last minute. The pronoun ""she"" is used to avoid repeating Cher's name and maintains the flow of the sentence while still referring to the same person. Mona Mondieu is mentioned as the character Cher was supposed to play, not as the subject of the action of backing out.",0,0

1. 'he is saddened': This 'he' likely refers to Andrew. The sentence structure suggests that Andrew is the one who called Ramirez naive, and then experienced an emotional reaction (being saddened).

2. 'he removed': This 'he' also appears to refer to Andrew. The action of removing the Red Woman's Husband's heart seems to be performed by the same person who was saddened by Ramirez's flinching.

Both instances of 'he' seem to refer to Andrew, not Ramirez. Andrew is the active character in this sentence, performing the actions and experiencing the emotions described.",1,0
1407,"The man is able to find the boy, but he fails to find a lark.",he,"0: the boy, 1: The man, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence has two main parts: ""The man is able to find the boy"" and ""but he fails to find a lark.""
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the second part of the sentence.
3. Logically, the person who is trying to find things is the same throughout the sentence.
4. The man is the subject of the first part, performing the action of finding.
5. It makes sense that the same person (the man) would be the one failing to find a lark in the second part.
6. The boy is the object being found in the first part, not the one doing the finding.

Based on this analysis, it's clear that ""he"" refers to ""The man"" rather than ""the boy.""",1,1

The sentence states that Rod McCary was offered the role of Herb Tarlek, but he (Rod McCary) turned it down. The pronoun ""he"" is used to avoid repeating Rod McCary's name and directly refers to him as the subject who made the decision to turn down the role. Therefore, the correct referent for the pronoun ""he"" is candidate 0.",1,0
1409,"Samuel manages to escape and tried to warn Mike, but he crashed into Dave's car anyway.",he,"0: Samuel, 1: Mike, 2: Neither","Let's analyze the sentence to determine who ""he"" refers to:

1. Samuel manages to escape and tried to warn Mike
2. But he crashed into Dave's car anyway

The pronoun ""he"" is used in the second part of the sentence, which describes the action of crashing into Dave's car. This action seems to contradict the warning that Samuel was trying to give to Mike.

Given this context, it's most likely that ""he"" refers to Mike for the following reasons:
1. Samuel was trying to warn Mike, implying that Mike was in danger of crashing.
2. The use of ""but"" suggests that despite Samuel's warning attempt, the crash still occurred.
3. If Samuel had crashed, it would be odd to mention his attempt to warn Mike in this context.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Mike (candidate 1).",1,1
1410,"Corday fatally stabbed Maya, though she did not attempt to flee.",she,"0: Corday, 1: Maya, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence has two subjects: Corday and Maya.
2. The main clause states that ""Corday fatally stabbed Maya.""
3. The subordinate clause ""though she did not attempt to flee"" provides additional information about one of the subjects.

Given the context, it's more logical that the person who would potentially flee would be the one who committed the stabbing, not the victim. Therefore, ""she"" in this case most likely refers to Corday.

The pronoun ""she"" is used to avoid repeating Corday's name, which is a common practice in writing to maintain flow and avoid redundancy.",0,0
1411,"Gang-du tries to explain this to the man, but his protests go ignored.",his,"0: Gang-du, 1: the man, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""his"" refers to Gang-du. The sentence structure indicates that Gang-du is the subject who is trying to explain something and making protests. The phrase ""his protests"" suggests that the protests belong to Gang-du, who is the one attempting to explain and being ignored. Therefore, ""his"" refers to Gang-du and not to ""the man"" who is ignoring the protests.",0,0

1. ""she couldn't live""
2. ""she had done""

For the first ""she,"" it's more likely referring to Lucille because the sentence is about Lucille being dead. It wouldn't make sense for Georgina to not be able to live with something if Lucille is the one who's dead.

For the second ""she,"" it's also more likely referring to Lucille. The sentence implies that Lucille did something that she couldn't live with, which led to her death.

Both instances of ""she"" seem to be referring to Lucille, not Georgina. Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" in this context refers to Lucille.",1,1
1413,Munro had proposed to stand for Tamaki in but only if he was unopposed for the party selection.,he,"0: Munro, 1: Tamaki, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" clearly refers to Munro. The sentence is discussing Munro's proposal to stand for Tamaki, and the pronoun ""he"" is used in reference to Munro's condition for standing (being unopposed for the party selection). Tamaki is mentioned as a place, not a person, so it cannot be the referent of ""he"". Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" refers to candidate 0, Munro.",0,0
1414,"Caitrin eventually agrees to surrender, and Loris is tried and executed, but not before he publicly reveals that Dhugal is Duncan's son.",he,"0: Caitrin, 1: Loris, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Loris. We can determine this for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure indicates that Loris is the subject of the latter part of the sentence, where the pronoun ""he"" is used.
2. The action of ""publicly reveals"" is more likely to be associated with Loris, who is being tried and executed, rather than Caitrin who has already surrendered.
3. The revelation about Dhugal being Duncan's son seems to be a significant piece of information that Loris discloses before his execution.
4. Caitrin is referred to with feminine pronouns (as evidenced by ""Caitrin eventually agrees to surrender""), so ""he"" would not be used for Caitrin.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" in this context refers to Loris.",1,1
1415,Ellie goes with Nadia initially but she runs away when she's distracted.,she,"0: Ellie, 1: Nadia, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Ellie goes with Nadia initially...""
2. Then it continues with ""but she runs away when she's distracted.""

The pronoun ""she"" is more likely to refer to Ellie for the following reasons:
1. Ellie is the subject of the first part of the sentence, making her the more prominent character.
2. The sentence structure suggests a contrast between Ellie's initial action (going with Nadia) and her subsequent action (running away).
3. It's more logical that Ellie would run away when distracted, as she's the one who initially went with Nadia.

While it's not impossible for ""she"" to refer to Nadia, the sentence structure and context make Ellie the more likely subject of the pronoun ""she.""",1,0

The first 'she' in 'she illegally impregnates her' clearly refers to Harriet, as Harriet is the subject of the sentence and the one falling in love with Phillipa. The second 'she' in 'she is lobotomized' is more ambiguous, but contextually it makes more sense for it to refer to Phillipa. Phillipa is the one being impregnated (illegally), and the lobotomization seems to be a consequence of trying to escape, which would likely be Phillipa's action given the situation described. Therefore, the pronoun 'she' in question most likely refers to Phillipa.",0,1
1417,"Lauren promises to support Tanya, but struggles to cope with her mother's illness.",her,"0: Lauren, 1: Tanya, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""her"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence mentions two people: Lauren and Tanya.
2. The pronoun ""her"" is used in the phrase ""her mother's illness.""
3. The sentence structure suggests that Lauren is the main subject, as she is the one promising to support Tanya and struggling to cope.
4. It's more likely that the sentence is talking about Lauren's mother's illness rather than Tanya's, as it would be unusual to mention Tanya's mother's illness without providing more context about Tanya.

Based on this analysis, it's most probable that ""her"" refers to Lauren, as the sentence is primarily about Lauren's actions and struggles.",1,0

""Eventually, the wasps drive the exterminators away after they sting them in the butt.""

In this sentence, ""them"" is the object of the verb ""sting."" We need to identify who is doing the stinging and who is being stung.

1. The wasps are the subject of the main clause ""the wasps drive the exterminators away.""
2. The pronoun ""they"" in the subordinate clause ""after they sting them"" refers back to ""the wasps.""
3. Therefore, ""them"" must refer to the object being stung, which is logically ""the exterminators.""

It wouldn't make sense for the wasps to sting themselves, so ""them"" cannot refer to ""the wasps."" The pronoun ""them"" clearly refers to ""the exterminators"" who are being stung by the wasps.",1,1

1. Eva is the subject of the main clause, making a promise to Eufemie.
2. The pronoun ""she"" appears in the conditional clause ""if she can cure Cador.""
3. The context suggests that Eufemie is the one who might cure Cador, as Eva is offering a reward (marriage to any available man) in exchange for this action.
4. It wouldn't make sense for Eva to promise herself a reward for curing Cador.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Eufemie, as she is the one who would potentially cure Cador and receive the reward of marriage.",1,1

1. The sentence starts with ""Feeling betrayed, Sonia divorces Carly again...""
2. This establishes Sonia as the subject performing the action of divorcing.
3. The pronoun ""she"" appears after ""but"" in the sentence, indicating a contrast or additional action by the same subject.
4. The pronoun ""she"" is agreeing to be Kristina's godmother.

Given this analysis, it's most logical that ""she"" refers to Sonia. Sonia is the main subject of the sentence, and it makes sense that she would be the one agreeing to be a godmother despite the differences mentioned. It's less likely that Carly, who is being divorced, would be the one agreeing to be a godmother in this context.",0,1
1421,"Manny probably strangled Hadley Marx as well, but he never confesses to it.",he,"0: Manny, 1: Hadley Marx, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" clearly refers to Manny for the following reasons:

1. Manny is the subject of the first clause, making him the most prominent entity in the sentence.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the second clause, which is connected to the first clause by ""but,"" indicating a continuation of the same subject.
3. The action of ""never confesses to it"" logically follows the action of ""probably strangled Hadley Marx,"" implying that the same person (Manny) is the subject of both actions.
4. Hadley Marx is mentioned as the object of the action (being strangled), not the subject, making it unlikely that ""he"" refers to Hadley Marx.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Manny.",0,0

The sentence states that ""Francesca is convicted of killing Cora,"" and then refers to ""her death"" as being an accident. This implies that Cora is the one who died accidentally, not Francesca. Therefore, ""her"" in this context refers to Cora.",1,1

1. The sentence starts with ""Amanda becomes suspicious of Jane.""
2. Then it continues with ""when she starts to pull away from her.""

The pronoun ""she"" in this context is more likely to refer to Jane because:
1. Jane is the object of Amanda's suspicion, so the following action is likely to be about Jane.
2. The phrase ""pull away from her"" suggests that ""she"" (the subject) is pulling away from ""her"" (Amanda).
3. It would be odd for Amanda to become suspicious of Jane because Amanda herself is pulling away.

The latter part of the sentence, ""then shows up late to Lucy Hubbard's christening,"" continues to describe the actions of the same person (Jane) that Amanda is suspicious of.

The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause about colliding with a wall, which is directly connected to Montoya's actions in the race. Rosberg had already been mentioned as retiring, so the pronoun cannot refer to him.",0,1
1426,"When Hel was defeated, Mani perished, but not before telling her sons how proud she was of them.",her,"0: Hel, 1: Mani, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""her"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Hel is mentioned first and is defeated.
2. Mani is mentioned second and perishes.
3. The pronoun ""her"" is used in the phrase ""telling her sons how proud she was of them.""

Based on this information, ""her"" most likely refers to Mani for the following reasons:
- The pronoun ""her"" is used in close proximity to Mani's actions.
- The sentence structure suggests that Mani is the one performing the action of telling her sons.
- It's more logical that Mani, who is perishing, would be telling her sons how proud she was of them as a final act.

While Hel is mentioned in the sentence, there's no clear connection between Hel and the sons or the act of expressing pride. Therefore, Mani (option 1) is the most likely referent for ""her.""",1,1
1427,"Simba sends Lutin down below, so that his mortal counterpart can replace him.",his,"0: Simba, 1: Lutin, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""his"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. Simba is the subject of the sentence, performing the action of sending Lutin.
2. Lutin is the object being sent down below.
3. The phrase ""his mortal counterpart"" implies ownership or association with one of the characters.
4. Given that Simba is the main actor in the sentence, it's more likely that ""his"" refers to Simba rather than Lutin.
5. The idea of a ""mortal counterpart"" suggests that Simba might be a non-mortal or supernatural being, and the sentence is describing the replacement of Simba with his mortal version.

Based on these points, it's most logical to conclude that ""his"" refers to Simba.",1,0

1. The pronoun ""her"" is used in the phrase ""her wife"".
2. ""Her"" is a possessive pronoun, indicating ownership or a relationship.
3. The sentence mentions two people: Victoria and Margerita.
4. Victoria is the subject of the sentence, performing the action of calling out.
5. Margerita is referred to as ""her wife"".

Given this information, ""her"" must refer to Victoria because:
- Victoria is the one calling out for Margerita.

The key point here is the refusal. Since Max is trying to run away with Jimmy, it's logical that Jimmy is the one who refused, not Max. Additionally, the mention of ""mental powers"" suggests that Jimmy is the one with these abilities, as he uses them to frighten Max.

Therefore, ""he"" in this context refers to Jimmy, not Max.",1,1
1431,"Malekith was ultimately defeated by Thor, but not before he destroyed the Casket of Ancient Winters, releasing magical frigid force all over the Earth.",he,"0: Malekith, 1: Thor, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Malekith. The reasoning is as follows:

1. The sentence structure indicates that the subject (Malekith) performed two actions:
   a) He was defeated by Thor
   b) He destroyed the Casket of Ancient Winters

2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the second part of the sentence to avoid repeating Malekith's name, which is a common practice in English to maintain flow and avoid redundancy.

3. The action of destroying the Casket of Ancient Winters is presented as something that happened before Malekith's defeat, which logically connects it to Malekith rather than Thor.

4. Thor is mentioned in the sentence, but he is the one who defeated Malekith, not the one who destroyed the Casket.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" in this context clearly refers to Malekith (candidate 0).",1,0
1432,Apparently Badalamenti waited to give to order to kill Peppino only after his bodyguard had died.,his,"0: Badalamenti, 1: Peppino, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""his"" most likely refers to Badalamenti. The sentence structure suggests that Badalamenti is the main subject and the one making the decision to give the order to kill Peppino. The phrase ""his bodyguard"" implies that the bodyguard belongs to Badalamenti, not Peppino. It would be unusual for Peppino to have a bodyguard in this context, especially since he is the target of the killing order. Therefore, ""his"" refers to Badalamenti's bodyguard.",1,0
1433,"Janet is in love with Wanda, but her father insists on her marrying a French lord.",her,"0: Janet, 1: Wanda, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""her"" appears twice. Let's analyze each occurrence:

1. ""her father"": This is likely referring to Janet's father, as the sentence is primarily about Janet's situation.
2. ""her marrying"": This also refers to Janet, as the sentence describes Janet's father insisting on her marriage.

The pronoun ""her"" in both cases refers to Janet, not Wanda. The sentence is describing Janet's situation - her love for Wanda and her father's insistence on her marrying someone else. Wanda is mentioned, but she is not the subject of the actions described by the pronoun ""her"".",0,0
1434,"Lucy is attracted to Gloria after she arrives home and finds her wearing nothing, but a bath towel.",she,"0: Lucy, 1: Gloria, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Lucy is attracted to Gloria""
2. Then it continues with ""after she arrives home""
3. The pronoun ""she"" is used in relation to arriving home
4. The sentence then mentions ""finds her wearing nothing, but a bath towel""

Based on this analysis, it's more logical that ""she"" refers to Lucy because:
- Lucy is the subject of the main clause
- The action of arriving home and then finding someone else in a towel implies that Lucy is the one who came home
- It would be less likely for Gloria to arrive home and find herself in a towel

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Lucy.",0,0
1435,"Gloria is also attracted to Lucy, but she knows that she is her half-sister and she refuses to let anything happen.",she,"0: Gloria, 1: Lucy, 2: Neither","In this sentence, there are multiple instances of the pronoun ""she"". Let's analyze each one:

1. ""...but she knows..."" - This ""she"" refers to Gloria, as Gloria is the subject of the main clause.
2. ""...that she is her half-sister..."" - This ""she"" refers to Lucy, as it's describing Lucy's relationship to Gloria.
3. ""...and she refuses..."" - This ""she"" refers back to Gloria, as it's continuing the action from the first clause.

Since the question doesn't specify which ""she"" we're focusing on, and there are instances referring to both Gloria and Lucy, we cannot definitively choose between them. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is ""Neither"", as we can't select a single referent for all instances of ""she"" in this sentence.",0,2
1436,Fergus goes through the mirror to try and help Carl but he gets sidetracked in the gold fields.,he,"0: Fergus, 1: Carl, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Fergus for the following reasons:

1. Fergus is the subject of the main clause and the first person mentioned in the sentence, making him the most prominent character.
2. The sentence structure suggests that the same person who ""goes through the mirror"" is the one who ""gets sidetracked in the gold fields.""
3. The purpose of Fergus going through the mirror is stated as trying to help Carl, which implies that Fergus is the active character in this scenario.
4. It would be less coherent for ""he"" to refer to Carl, as Carl is not described as taking any action in the sentence.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Fergus (candidate 0).",0,0
1437,"Knabe lost to La Mirada Mayor Wayne R. Grisham, but he carried his home area.",his,"0: Knabe, 1: La Mirada Mayor Wayne R. Grisham, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""his"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence mentions two individuals: Knabe and La Mirada Mayor Wayne R. Grisham.
2. The pronoun ""his"" is used in the phrase ""his home area.""
3. The sentence structure suggests that Knabe is the main subject of the sentence, as it starts with ""Knabe lost to...""
4. The second part of the sentence, ""but he carried his home area,"" provides additional information about Knabe.
5. It's more logical and natural for the sentence to be referring to Knabe's home area rather than Grisham's, as it's contrasting Knabe's overall loss with his success in his local area.

Based on these observations, it's most likely that ""his"" refers to Knabe.",1,0
1438,Layla deserted Sigyn but she continued to be a devoted wife.,she,"0: Layla, 1: Sigyn, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and meaning of the sentence:

1. The sentence starts with ""Layla deserted Sigyn,"" indicating that Layla left or abandoned Sigyn.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is then used in the second part of the sentence: ""but she continued to be a devoted wife.""
3. The use of ""but"" suggests a contrast between the first and second parts of the sentence.
4. It wouldn't make sense for Layla to desert Sigyn and then be described as a devoted wife.
5. Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Sigyn, who remained a devoted wife despite being deserted by Layla.

Based on this analysis, the pronoun ""she"" refers to Sigyn.",0,1
1439,"Cable and the Avengers battled the Harbingers, but they adapted to all of their attacks.",they,"0: the Harbingers, 1: Cable and the Avengers, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" most likely refers to ""the Harbingers"" for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""they"" is the subject of the second clause, which is describing an action (adapting to attacks) performed by a group.

2. It's more logical that the enemies (the Harbingers) would be adapting to the attacks of Cable and the Avengers, rather than Cable and the Avengers adapting to their own attacks.

3. The use of ""but"" indicates a contrast between the two clauses. The first clause describes Cable and the Avengers battling the Harbingers, while the second clause describes an action that counters or complicates this battle, which would be the Harbingers adapting to the attacks.

Therefore, ""they"" most likely refers to ""the Harbingers"" (candidate 0).",0,0
1440,"Xue participated in attacking Jiaozhi, but he died on his return journey.",he,"0: Xue, 1: Jiaozhi, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, let's analyze the sentence:

1. The sentence mentions two entities: Xue and Jiaozhi.
2. Xue is the subject of the sentence and is performing the action of ""participating in attacking.""
3. Jiaozhi is the object being attacked.
4. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the second part of the sentence, referring to the person who ""died on his return journey.""
5. Logically, the person returning from the attack would be the attacker, not the place being attacked.
6. Therefore, ""he"" must refer to Xue, as Xue is the one who participated in the attack and would be the one returning.

Based on this analysis, the pronoun ""he"" clearly refers to Xue.",1,0
1441,"Jack continued to try to move in on James, but he refused to admit that was what he was doing.",he,"0: Jack, 1: James, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""he"" the pronoun refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. The first ""he"" in the sentence: ""...but he refused to admit...""
   This ""he"" is more likely referring to Jack because:
   - Jack is the subject of the first part of the sentence.
   - The sentence is describing Jack's actions (trying to move in on James).
   - It would make more sense for Jack to refuse to admit what he was doing, rather than James refusing to admit what Jack was doing.

2. The second ""he"" in the sentence: ""...that was what he was doing.""
   This ""he"" also refers to Jack for the same reasons as above. It's describing the action that Jack was refusing to admit.

Both instances of ""he"" in this sentence refer to Jack, as he is the main actor in the situation described.",0,0
1442,"Jack later escaped to find James, after an alive Peter kidnapped him.",him,"0: Jack, 1: James, 2: Neither","Let's analyze the sentence to determine who ""him"" refers to:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""him"" is the object of the verb ""kidnapped"".
2. The subject of ""kidnapped"" is ""an alive Peter"".
3. The sentence states that ""Jack later escaped"", which implies that Jack was the one who was kidnapped and then escaped.
4. James is mentioned as someone Jack was trying to find after escaping, so James is not likely to be the one who was kidnapped.

Based on this analysis, ""him"" most likely refers to Jack. Jack was kidnapped by Peter and then escaped to find James.",1,0
1443,"Tanya assumed Caroline Spencer is interested, even though she was engaged to Ridge.",she,"0: Tanya, 1: Caroline Spencer, 2: Neither","To determine who the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence mentions two female characters: Tanya and Caroline Spencer.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""she was engaged to Ridge.""
3. The sentence structure suggests that ""she"" refers to Caroline Spencer, not Tanya, because:
   a. The main clause is about Tanya's assumption about Caroline Spencer.
   b. The subordinate clause introduced by ""even though"" provides additional information about Caroline Spencer, not Tanya.
4. It's more logical that Caroline Spencer would be engaged to Ridge, as this is presented as a contrast to Tanya's assumption about Caroline's interest.

Based on these points, it's clear that ""she"" refers to Caroline Spencer.",0,1
1444,"Thorne arrived and saved Brody, but before he could get to Macy, the car exploded.",he,"0: Thorne, 1: Brody, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Thorne for the following reasons:

1. Thorne is the subject of the first clause and the main actor in the sentence.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the second part of the sentence to continue describing Thorne's actions.
3. The sentence structure suggests that the same person (Thorne) who saved Brody was also trying to get to Macy.
4. There's no indication of a shift in subject between ""saved Brody"" and ""could get to Macy,"" implying that ""he"" refers to the same person throughout the sentence.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Thorne (candidate 0).",1,0
1445,"Johnston's men killed several guerrillas, but then they were overrun.",they,"0: several guerrillas, 1: Johnston 's men, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and grammatical structure of the sentence.

1. The sentence describes two groups: ""Johnston's men"" and ""several guerrillas.""
2. The first part of the sentence states that ""Johnston's men killed several guerrillas.""
3. The second part, connected by ""but then,"" describes what happened next: ""they were overrun.""
4. Logically, the group that was ""overrun"" would be the one that was initially successful in the conflict.
5. Since Johnston's men were the ones who ""killed several guerrillas,"" it makes sense that they would be the group referred to as being ""overrun"" afterwards.

Therefore, ""they"" most likely refers to ""Johnston's men"" rather than the guerrillas or neither group.",1,1
1446,Victor then tried to plead with Mysterio but instead he accidentally shoved him off the ropes.,him,"0: Victor, 1: Mysterio, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""him"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Victor is the subject of the sentence, performing the actions of trying to plead and accidentally shoving.
2. Mysterio is the object of Victor's actions.
3. The pronoun ""him"" is used in the phrase ""shoved him off the ropes.""

Given this information, it's clear that ""him"" refers to Mysterio, not Victor. Victor is the one doing the shoving, and Mysterio is the one being shoved. It wouldn't make sense for Victor to shove himself off the ropes.

Therefore, the pronoun ""him"" refers to Mysterio, which is candidate 1.",1,1
1447,Delilah is romantically attracted to Gwen but she plays mind games and teases her.,she,"0: Delilah, 1: Gwen, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Delilah is romantically attracted to Gwen.""
2. The second part of the sentence uses ""she"" and describes actions: ""plays mind games and teases her.""

Given this information, it's more likely that ""she"" refers to Delilah for the following reasons:
- Delilah is the subject of the first part of the sentence, making her the more prominent actor.
- The actions described (playing mind games and teasing) align with the idea of someone who is romantically attracted to another person but not directly expressing it.
- The use of ""her"" at the end of the sentence likely refers to Gwen, further supporting that ""she"" is Delilah.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Delilah.",1,0
1448,"Cassandra tries to reconcile with Paula, but she dies in a car crash.",she,"0: Cassandra, 1: Paula, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence has two subjects: Cassandra and Paula.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the second part of the sentence, after the comma.
3. The action associated with ""she"" is ""dies in a car crash.""

Given this information, we can deduce that ""she"" most likely refers to Paula for the following reasons:
- The sentence structure suggests a sequence of events: Cassandra's attempt to reconcile, followed by someone's death.
- It would be illogical for Cassandra to try to reconcile with Paula if Cassandra herself had died.
- The use of ""but"" indicates a contrast or unexpected outcome, implying that the reconciliation attempt was unsuccessful due to Paula's death.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Paula.",0,1
1449,"Julian Holloway was originally cast to play Roger, but a BBC strike delayed filming by a week and he was replaced by Ken Campbell.",he,"0: Roger, 1: Julian Holloway, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Julian Holloway. The sentence states that Julian Holloway was originally cast to play Roger, but due to a BBC strike, he (Julian Holloway) was replaced by Ken Campbell. The pronoun ""he"" is used to avoid repeating Julian Holloway's name and clearly refers back to him as the subject of the replacement.",0,1
1450,"The Bruins brought in the four new players but they did little to help, winning just one of the eight starts they made for Boston.",they,"0: the four new players, 1: The Bruins, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, let's analyze the sentence:

1. The sentence starts with ""The Bruins brought in the four new players.""
2. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the second part of the sentence: ""but they did little to help.""
3. The sentence then mentions ""winning just one of the eight starts they made for Boston.""

Based on this analysis:
- ""They"" is used to refer to the subject that ""did little to help"" and ""made eight starts for Boston.""
- This clearly refers to ""the four new players"" rather than ""The Bruins.""
- The Bruins are the team that brought in the new players, not the ones who made the starts.

Therefore, the pronoun ""they"" refers to ""the four new players.""",0,0
1451,"The pod people try to raid the family's house, but they are able to escape.",they,"0: the family, 1: The pod people, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" most likely refers to ""the family"" for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""they"" is the subject of the second clause, which describes an action (escaping) that contrasts with the pod people's action (raiding).

2. It's more logical and common in storytelling for the protagonists (likely the family in this context) to be the ones escaping from a threat, rather than the antagonists (the pod people) escaping from their own raid.

3. The use of ""but"" indicates a contrast between the two clauses. If ""they"" referred to the pod people, there wouldn't be a clear contrast between raiding and escaping.

Therefore, ""they"" most likely refers to ""the family"" who are able to escape the raid attempt by the pod people.",1,0
1452,"Oron is punished, though not treated as severely as Karl, because of his having acted under duress.",his,"0: Oron, 1: Karl, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""his"" refers to Oron for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure indicates that Oron is the main subject of the clause containing ""his.""
2. The phrase ""his having acted under duress"" is used to explain why Oron is punished less severely than Karl.
3. It would not make sense for ""his"" to refer to Karl in this context, as Karl is mentioned as a point of comparison for Oron's punishment.
4. The pronoun ""his"" is closer to ""Oron"" in the sentence, which is often (but not always) an indicator of the pronoun's referent.

Therefore, the pronoun ""his"" most likely refers to Oron.",0,0
1453,"Nicole initially takes the blame for Sharon, but she later admits the truth to Harold, who lets her keep her job.",she,"0: Nicole, 1: Sharon, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which person the pronoun ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Nicole initially takes the blame for Sharon.""
2. Then it continues with ""but she later admits the truth to Harold.""

The pronoun ""she"" is used in the second part of the sentence, which describes an action that contradicts or follows up on the initial action. Since Nicole is the subject of the first action (taking the blame), it's logical that she would be the one to later admit the truth. 

Additionally, the sentence ends with ""who lets her keep her job,"" which further supports that Nicole is the one being referred to, as she would be the one whose job is at stake after admitting the truth.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Nicole.",1,0

The sentence is describing Gonzy's abilities at fortune-telling, which are respected by the others on the Gekko. The pronoun ""his"" is used to indicate possession of these abilities, and Gonzy is the only person mentioned in the text who could possess these abilities. The Gekko is a ship or vessel, not a person, so it cannot possess fortune-telling abilities. Therefore, the pronoun ""his"" must refer to Gonzy.",1,0
1455,"Bob defeats and stakes Malik, but he fails to kill him, something she fails to realize.",him,"0: Bob, 1: Malik, 2: Neither","Let's analyze the sentence step by step:

1. ""Bob defeats and stakes Malik"" - This establishes that Bob is the subject (doer of the action) and Malik is the object (receiver of the action).

2. ""but he fails to kill him"" - Here we have two pronouns: ""he"" and ""him"".
   - ""he"" refers to Bob, as he's the one who defeated and staked Malik.
   - ""him"" refers to Malik, as he's the one Bob failed to kill.

3. The pronoun we're asked about is ""him"", which in this context clearly refers to Malik.

4. The last part ""something she fails to realize"" introduces a new character (she), but this doesn't affect our analysis of ""him"".

Therefore, the pronoun ""him"" in this sentence refers to Malik.",1,1
1456,"Bradley married Dr. Vento, despite the fact that he didn't like doctors.",he,"0: Bradley, 1: Dr. Vento, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Bradley. The reasoning is as follows:

1. The sentence structure suggests that Bradley is the main subject of the sentence.
2. The clause ""despite the fact that he didn't like doctors"" provides additional information about Bradley's feelings.
3. It would be unusual for Dr. Vento to not like doctors, as Dr. Vento is a doctor (indicated by the title ""Dr."").
4. The use of ""he"" implies that the person being referred to is male, which aligns with Bradley (a typically male name).

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Bradley, who is the first candidate (index 0) in the given options.",1,0
1457,"Donna is still willing to marry Emilia, but she rejects her.",she,"0: Emilia, 1: Donna, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, let's analyze the sentence:

""Donna is still willing to marry Emilia, but she rejects her.""

In this sentence, we have two actions:
1. Donna is willing to marry Emilia
2. Someone (represented by ""she"") rejects someone else (represented by ""her"")

The pronoun ""she"" is used as the subject of the second action (rejecting). Given the context, it's more logical that ""she"" refers to Emilia, who is rejecting Donna's willingness to marry her. This interpretation makes more sense because:

1. If ""she"" referred to Donna, it would contradict the first part of the sentence where Donna is said to be willing to marry Emilia.
2. The use of ""but"" indicates a contrast between Donna's willingness and the rejection, suggesting that the rejection is coming from the other person, Emilia.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Emilia (candidate 0).",0,0
1458,"Cathy forgives Lindsey, but she becomes upset when she tells her that she wants to get on with her life.",she,"0: Cathy, 1: Lindsey, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. 'Cathy forgives Lindsey' - This sets up the initial action.
2. 'but she becomes upset' - This 'she' likely refers to Cathy, as it's a contrast to her forgiving action.
3. 'when she tells her' - This 'she' is probably Lindsey telling Cathy something.
4. 'that she wants to get on with her life' - This 'she' is again likely Lindsey, expressing her desire to move on.

The pronoun 'she' appears multiple times in this sentence, and it refers to both Cathy and Lindsey at different points. However, the specific 'she' we're asked about is not specified. Without knowing which instance of 'she' we're supposed to analyze, we can't definitively choose between Cathy and Lindsey.

Therefore, the most appropriate answer is 'Neither', as we can't determine a single referent for 'she' in this context.",0,2
1459,"Cathy is not happy that Raylene wants to stay behind, but she gives her her blessing.",she,"0: Cathy, 1: Raylene, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Cathy is not happy about something Raylene wants to do.
2. ""She"" gives ""her"" blessing.

The pronoun ""she"" is more likely to refer to Cathy because:
1. Cathy is the subject of the first clause and is mentioned first, making her the more prominent character.
2. The action of giving blessing implies that Cathy, who is not happy about Raylene's decision, is still allowing or accepting it.
3. It would be unusual for Raylene to give herself blessing for her own decision.

Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Cathy, who is giving her blessing to Raylene despite being unhappy about the situation.",0,0
1460,Ginette falls in love with May after she helps her recover from her mental illness.,she,"0: Ginette, 1: May, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Ginette falls in love with May.""
2. This is followed by ""after she helps her recover from her mental illness.""

The pronoun ""she"" in this context is most likely referring to May for the following reasons:
1. The sentence structure suggests that May is the one helping Ginette.
2. It's more logical that Ginette falls in love with May as a result of May's actions (helping her recover).
3. If ""she"" referred to Ginette, the sentence would imply that Ginette falls in love with May after Ginette helps May, which doesn't make as much sense in this context.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to May (candidate 1).",0,1
1461,"Kelly starts picking on Ayesha again, until Marie finally snaps at her telling her how stupid she is.",her,"0: Kelly, 1: Ayesha, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""her"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions three people: Kelly, Ayesha, and Marie.
2. The pronoun ""her"" appears twice in the sentence.
3. The first ""her"" is likely referring to Kelly, as Marie is snapping at the person who is picking on Ayesha.
4. The second ""her"" is also likely referring to Kelly, as it's part of the phrase ""telling her how stupid she is,"" which is a continuation of Marie's action towards the person she's snapping at.

Given this analysis, it's most probable that both instances of ""her"" refer to Kelly, as she is the one being reprimanded by Marie for picking on Ayesha.",1,0
1462,"Omar shoots Mouzone, but he lets him live after realizing things did n't add up.",him,"0: Omar, 1: Mouzone, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""him"" refers to Mouzone. We can determine this because:

1. Omar is the subject of the sentence and is performing the action of shooting.
2. Mouzone is the object of the sentence and is being shot.
3. The pronoun ""him"" is used in the second part of the sentence, ""he lets him live,"" where ""he"" refers to Omar (the subject) and ""him"" refers to Mouzone (the object being let live).
4. It wouldn't make sense for Omar to let himself live, so ""him"" must refer to Mouzone.

Therefore, the pronoun ""him"" refers to Mouzone, which is candidate 1.",0,1
1463,Carl then realizes that Peter is innocent if he genuinely believed him to be guilty.,he,"0: Carl, 1: Peter, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Carl realizes something about Peter's innocence.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the conditional clause ""if he genuinely believed him to be guilty.""

The most logical interpretation is that ""he"" refers to Carl, not Peter. This is because:

1. Carl is the subject of the main clause and is doing the realizing.
2. It makes more sense for Carl to be the one believing Peter to be guilty, rather than Peter believing himself to be guilty.
3. The use of ""him"" later in the sentence likely refers to Peter, which supports ""he"" referring to Carl.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Carl.",1,0
1464,Michaela befriends the recovered Irma but she ignores her when she demands to know what happened on the Rock.,her,"0: Michaela, 1: the recovered Irma, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""her"" the pronoun ""she"" is referring to when it says ""she ignores her."" Let's break it down:

1. Michaela befriends the recovered Irma
2. ""she ignores her""
3. ""she demands to know what happened on the Rock""

The most logical interpretation is that Irma is the one demanding to know what happened on the Rock, and Michaela is ignoring her. This makes sense because:

1. Irma is described as ""recovered,"" implying she might have experienced something on the Rock and wants to know about it.
2. Michaela, as the subject of the first clause, is more likely to be the subject of the second clause (ignoring).

Therefore, ""her"" in this context refers to Irma (the recovered Irma).",1,1

1. The sentence mentions two female names: Jodie and Brenda.
2. The pronoun ""her"" is used in the phrase ""her dad Colonel Three - not - Three"".
3. The sentence structure suggests that ""her dad"" is associated with one of the two girls mentioned earlier.
4. The following part of the sentence, ""does not like the boy"", implies that the dad is protective of his daughter.
5. Given that Jodie is mentioned first and is the subject of the sentence, it's more likely that the pronoun ""her"" refers to Jodie.

Based on this analysis, it's most probable that ""her"" refers to Jodie, as it's common in English for the first-mentioned subject to be the referent of subsequent pronouns unless explicitly stated otherwise.",0,0
1466,"Mabel valliantly fought Bundy, but he was disqualified after clotheslining him out of the ring.",he,"0: Mabel, 1: Bundy, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. The pronoun ""he"" is masculine, so it must refer to a male person.
2. Mabel is typically a female name, so it's unlikely to be the referent for ""he"".
3. Bundy is more likely to be a male name.
4. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" refers to the person who was disqualified, which is logically the opponent of Mabel.
5. The phrase ""clotheslining him out of the ring"" implies that the person referred to by ""he"" performed this action on someone else (likely Mabel).

Given these points, it's most logical that ""he"" refers to Bundy. Bundy was disqualified for clotheslining Mabel out of the ring.",1,1
1467,Batista went after Booker right when he was entering the ring.,he,"0: Batista, 1: Booker, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Booker. The context suggests that Batista is the one performing the action (""went after""), while Booker is the one being acted upon. The phrase ""right when he was entering the ring"" indicates that ""he"" is the person entering the ring, which is more likely to be Booker in this scenario. Batista is already described as taking action, so it's logical to assume that Booker is the one entering the ring and being targeted by Batista.",1,1
1468,Dr. Ibrahim allowed Ariri to try out only if he agreed to continue to play soccer.,he,"0: Ariri, 1: Dr. Ibrahim, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence is about Dr. Ibrahim allowing Ariri to do something.
2. The condition for allowing this is that ""he"" agreed to continue playing soccer.
3. Logically, the person who needs to agree to continue playing soccer would be Ariri, not Dr. Ibrahim.
4. It wouldn't make sense for Dr. Ibrahim to be the one agreeing to continue playing soccer in this context.
5. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the subordinate clause that describes the condition for Ariri's tryout.

Based on these points, it's clear that ""he"" refers to Ariri, as Ariri is the one who needs to agree to continue playing soccer in order to try out.",1,0
1469,Killer Shrike was right behind Hobgoblin when he led his forces into battle against the Goblin King's Goblin Nation.,he,"0: Hobgoblin, 1: Killer Shrike, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Hobgoblin for the following reasons:

1. Hobgoblin is mentioned immediately before the pronoun ""he"" in the sentence, making it the most recent and logical antecedent.

2. The action described (""led his forces into battle"") is more consistent with a leadership role, which is typically associated with Hobgoblin rather than Killer Shrike in the context of Marvel comics.

3. The sentence structure suggests that Killer Shrike was following Hobgoblin, implying that Hobgoblin was the one leading the charge.

While Killer Shrike is mentioned first in the sentence, the pronoun ""he"" is more closely associated with Hobgoblin both grammatically and contextually.",0,0
1470,Karl attracts the unwanted attention of Captain Louis but he evades him and throws him into the wall.,he,"0: Karl, 1: Captain Louis, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""he"" refers to. There are two instances of ""he"" in the sentence, so we need to analyze them separately:

1. First ""he"": ""...but he evades him...""
   This ""he"" is performing the action of evading, which logically refers to Karl, as he is trying to avoid Captain Louis's unwanted attention.

2. Second ""he"": ""...and throws him into the wall.""
   This ""he"" is also performing an action (throwing), which again logically refers to Karl, as he is continuing his evasive actions against Captain Louis.

Both instances of ""he"" refer to Karl, as he is the subject performing the actions of evading and throwing. Captain Louis is the object receiving these actions (being evaded and thrown).",0,0
1471,"Max uses this to get close to Kyle Ratcliffe, but when he refuses to sleep with him, Kyle lies claiming they slept together.",he,"0: Max, 1: Kyle Ratcliffe, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. ""Max uses this to get close to Kyle Ratcliffe"" - This establishes that Max is trying to get close to Kyle.

2. ""but when he refuses to sleep with him"" - Here, we need to determine who ""he"" refers to. Given the context, it's more likely that Kyle is the one refusing to sleep with Max, not the other way around. This is because Max is described as trying to get close to Kyle, implying Max is the one pursuing Kyle.

3. ""Kyle lies claiming they slept together"" - This confirms that Kyle is the one who refused to sleep with Max, and then lied about it.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" in this context refers to Kyle Ratcliffe, as he is the one refusing to sleep with Max.",1,1
1472,Proposition Joe is worried that Avon Barksdale might not be so keen to share his territory.,his,"0: Avon Barksdale, 1: Proposition Joe, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""his"" refers to Avon Barksdale's territory. The context suggests that Proposition Joe is concerned about Avon Barksdale's willingness to share territory. It's logical to assume that the territory in question belongs to Avon Barksdale, not Proposition Joe, as Joe is the one worried about sharing. Therefore, ""his"" refers to Avon Barksdale.",1,0
1473,Russell suggests that Sobotka would talk if he approached him and Pearlman gives him the OK.,he,"0: Russell, 1: Sobotka, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""he"" refers to. Let's break it down:

1. Russell is the subject of the sentence, suggesting something about Sobotka.
2. The pronoun ""he"" appears in the phrase ""if he approached him"".
3. Given the context, it makes more sense for Russell to be the one approaching Sobotka, rather than Sobotka approaching himself.
4. The sentence structure implies that Russell is the one who would be doing the approaching, and Sobotka is the one who would potentially talk.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" in this context most likely refers to Russell.",1,0
1474,"Corwin attempts to attack Boogedy, but he uses his magic to turn his assault against him.",he,"0: Corwin, 1: Boogedy, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""he"" refers to. Let's break it down:

1. Corwin attempts to attack Boogedy
2. ""he"" uses his magic
3. The magic turns the assault against ""him""

The pronoun ""he"" is most likely referring to Boogedy because:
1. Boogedy is the one being attacked, so he would be the one to defend himself.
2. The magic is used to turn the assault against ""him"" (Corwin), which implies that Boogedy is the one using the magic.
3. It's more natural to introduce a new subject with a name (Corwin) and then refer to the second subject (Boogedy) with a pronoun in the following clause.

Therefore, ""he"" in this context most likely refers to Boogedy.",0,1
1475,Vicki becomes concerned about Ann when she sees her watching Mikey assemble a gun.,she,"0: Vicki, 1: Ann, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Vicki becomes concerned about Ann"".
2. This is followed by ""when she sees her"".
3. The pronoun ""she"" is the subject of the verb ""sees"".
4. Given the sentence structure, ""she"" is most likely referring to the person who becomes concerned, which is Vicki.
5. The pronoun ""her"" later in the sentence is likely referring to Ann, as Vicki is seeing Ann watching Mikey.

Based on this analysis, the pronoun ""she"" in this context is most likely referring to Vicki.",0,0
1476,"Meanwhile, Luke is kidnapped by Henry, but he is found by Anna just as the cabin he is being held in is burning down.",he,"0: Henry, 1: Luke, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence mentions two male characters: Luke and Henry.
2. The pronoun ""he"" appears twice in the sentence.
3. The first ""he"" in ""but he is found by Anna"" likely refers to Luke because:
   - Luke is the subject of the first clause (Luke is kidnapped).
   - It makes more sense for Anna to find the kidnapped person (Luke) rather than the kidnapper (Henry).
4. The second ""he"" in ""he is being held"" also refers to Luke because:
   - It's describing the person being held in the cabin, which is the kidnapped person (Luke).
   - This is consistent with the first ""he"" also referring to Luke.

Given this analysis, both instances of ""he"" in the sentence refer to Luke, not Henry.",1,1
1477,"Meanwhile, Luke is kidnapped by Henry, but he is found by Anna just as the cabin he is being held in is burning down.",he,"0: Henry, 1: Luke, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence mentions two male characters: Luke and Henry.

1478,"The dealers are arrested by narcotics cops when they try to buy cocaine from an undercover officer, Troy Wiggins.",they,"0: The dealers, 1: narcotics cops, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" clearly refers to ""The dealers"" for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure indicates that ""The dealers"" is the subject of the main clause.
2. The pronoun ""they"" is used as the subject of the subordinate clause ""when they try to buy cocaine.""
3. It makes logical sense that the dealers would be the ones trying to buy cocaine, not the narcotics cops.
4. The narcotics cops are mentioned as the ones arresting the dealers, so they cannot be the ones trying to buy cocaine.

Therefore, ""they"" refers to ""The dealers"" and not to ""narcotics cops"" or any other entity not mentioned as a candidate.",0,0
1479,Iva loves Amanda so much that she endures the scorn she feels for her - as she fights to win her love.,she,"0: Amanda, 1: Iva, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""she"" refers to Iva or Amanda. Let's break it down:

1. ""Iva loves Amanda so much that she endures the scorn...""
   This ""she"" likely refers to Iva, as she is the one who loves Amanda and would be enduring something for her.

2. ""...she feels for her...""
   This ""she"" also likely refers to Iva, feeling scorn for Amanda.

3. ""...as she fights to win her love.""
   This ""she"" is also most likely Iva, as she is the one trying to win Amanda's love.

All instances of ""she"" in this sentence seem to refer to Iva. The sentence is describing Iva's actions and feelings towards Amanda. Amanda is the object of Iva's affections and actions, not the subject performing the actions.",1,1
1480,Jack is also there for Andrew when he and his father disagree.,he,"0: Jack, 1: Andrew, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who the pronoun ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence mentions two people: Jack and Andrew.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the phrase ""when he and his father disagree.""
3. Logically, it wouldn't make sense for Jack to disagree with Andrew's father, as the sentence is about Jack being there for Andrew.
4. It's more likely that Andrew is the one who disagrees with his own father, and Jack is there to support Andrew during these disagreements.

Based on this analysis, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Andrew.",1,1
1481,"Brady Hoke succeeded Rodriguez, but after four years of steadily declining results, he was dismissed following his fourth season.",his,"0: Rodriguez, 1: Brady Hoke, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""his"" refers to Brady Hoke. The sentence structure indicates that Brady Hoke succeeded Rodriguez and then provides information about Hoke's tenure. The phrase ""he was dismissed following his fourth season"" clearly refers to Brady Hoke, as it's describing the end of his time as a coach after four years. The pronoun ""his"" in this context is referring to Brady Hoke's fourth season, not Rodriguez's.",0,1
1482,Elizabeth Hurley was to return to play Vanessa but she turned down the role after being busy with other films.,she,"0: Vanessa, 1: Elizabeth Hurley, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" clearly refers to Elizabeth Hurley. The sentence structure indicates that Elizabeth Hurley was the one who was originally intended to return to play the role of Vanessa, but she (Elizabeth Hurley) turned down the role. The reason given for turning down the role (being busy with other films) is a personal decision that would be made by the actress, not the character Vanessa. Therefore, ""she"" in this context refers to Elizabeth Hurley.",0,1
1483,"Wanda tries to apologize to Rose, but she is refused.",she,"0: Wanda, 1: Rose, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""but she is refused."" Given the context, it's more logical that Rose is the one refusing, rather than being refused. This implies that Wanda is the one being refused when trying to apologize. Therefore, ""she"" in this sentence refers to Wanda.",1,0
1484,"Wanda tries to apologize to Rose, but she refuses to accept.",she,"0: Wanda, 1: Rose, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which person the pronoun ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Wanda is trying to apologize to Rose.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""she refuses to accept.""

Given this information, it's clear that ""she"" refers to Rose because:
- Wanda is the one apologizing, so she's not refusing anything.
- Rose is the one being apologized to, and the sentence states that there's a refusal to accept the apology.

Therefore, ""she"" in this context refers to Rose, who is refusing to accept Wanda's apology.",1,1
1485,Leona served Patricia well until the death of her mother meant that finances became pretty tight.,her,"0: Leona, 1: Patricia, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""her"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence mentions two people: Leona and Patricia.
2. The pronoun ""her"" is used in the phrase ""her mother.""
3. The sentence structure suggests that the financial situation changed due to the death of someone's mother.

Given this information, it's more likely that ""her"" refers to Patricia rather than Leona. The sentence implies that Leona was serving Patricia, and then Patricia's financial situation changed due to her mother's death. It would be less logical for Leona's mother's death to affect Patricia's finances.

Therefore, the pronoun ""her"" most likely refers to Patricia.",0,1
1486,Belinda soon fires Marilyn so Morag Bellingham decides to give her a job.,her,"0: Belinda, 1: Marilyn, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""her"" most likely refers to Marilyn. The reasoning is as follows:

1. The sentence structure indicates that Belinda fires Marilyn.
2. After this event, Morag Bellingham decides to give ""her"" a job.
3. It makes logical sense that Morag would offer a job to the person who just lost their job (Marilyn) rather than the person who did the firing (Belinda).
4. The pronoun ""her"" is used in the context of receiving a job offer, which aligns with Marilyn's situation of having just been fired.

Therefore, the pronoun ""her"" most likely refers to Marilyn.",1,1
1487,"Kate uncovers evidence implicating Jill; but, when the police move to apprehend her, they discover her corpse.",her,"0: Kate, 1: Jill, 2: Neither","In this sentence, there are two instances of the pronoun ""her"". Let's analyze each:

1. ""when the police move to apprehend her"":
This ""her"" likely refers to Jill. The context suggests that Kate uncovered evidence against Jill, which would lead to the police trying to apprehend Jill, not Kate.

2. ""they discover her corpse"":
This ""her"" also most likely refers to Jill. The sentence structure implies that the person the police were trying to apprehend (Jill) is the same person whose corpse they discovered.

Both instances of ""her"" in this sentence appear to refer to Jill, not Kate. Therefore, the pronoun ""her"" refers to candidate 1: Jill.",1,1
1488,"Leene was heartbroken and agreed to marry Axel, but he told him that he would always love Yuujel and could never love him.",him,"0: Leene, 1: Axel, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""him"" the pronoun refers to. Let's break it down:

1. Leene agreed to marry Axel.
2. ""He"" (referring to Leene, as Leene is the subject of the first clause) told ""him"" (referring to Axel) something.
3. The content of what was told is that ""he"" (Leene) would always love Yuujel and could never love ""him"" (Axel).

The pronoun ""him"" appears twice in this sentence, and both times it refers to Axel. Leene is the one doing the telling, and Axel is the one being told. The final ""him"" in ""could never love him"" also refers to Axel, as Leene is explaining that they can't love Axel.

Therefore, the pronoun ""him"" refers to Axel.",1,1
1489,The footballers' careers started with Queens Park Rangers but they moved to Manchester City before they had played a game.,they,"0: Queens Park Rangers, 1: The footballers', 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. ""The footballers' careers started with Queens Park Rangers"" - This introduces the footballers and their initial association with Queens Park Rangers.

2. ""but they moved to Manchester City"" - Here, ""they"" is used as a pronoun. We need to determine who ""they"" refers to.

3. ""before they had played a game"" - This second ""they"" likely refers to the same group as the first ""they"".

The pronoun ""they"" is plural, which immediately rules out ""Queens Park Rangers"" as the referent, since a football club is typically referred to in the singular.

""The footballers'"" is plural and matches with the plural pronoun ""they"". It makes logical sense that the footballers would be the ones moving to Manchester City and not having played a game yet.

Therefore, ""they"" most likely refers to ""The footballers'"".",0,1
1490,"The youthful team under coach Duan Ivkovi depended initially on leader Vassilis Spanoulis, losing games regularly when he wasn't playing.",he,"0: coach Duan Ivkovi, 1: leader Vassilis Spanoulis, 2: Neither","The pronoun ""he"" in this context refers to leader Vassilis Spanoulis. The sentence states that the team was losing games regularly when ""he"" wasn't playing. It's logical that this refers to a player rather than the coach, as coaches typically don't play in games. Additionally, Vassilis Spanoulis is specifically mentioned as the ""leader"" of the team, which further supports the idea that his absence would have a significant impact on the team's performance.",1,1
1491,"McNulty says that Wallace is dead, but D'Angelo does not believe him.",him,"0: McNulty, 1: Wallace, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""him"" refers to McNulty. The sentence structure indicates that D'Angelo does not believe ""him,"" and the only person mentioned who is making a statement that could be disbelieved is McNulty. McNulty is the one saying that Wallace is dead, so D'Angelo's disbelief is directed towards McNulty's statement. Therefore, ""him"" in this context refers to McNulty.",1,0
1492,"Delilah also becomes interested in Sonia, but she rejects her marriage proposal.",she,"0: Delilah, 1: Sonia, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Delilah becomes interested in Sonia.
2. ""She"" rejects a marriage proposal.

The pronoun ""she"" is more likely to refer to Sonia because:
- Delilah is the one who becomes interested in Sonia, suggesting that Delilah would be the one proposing marriage.
- The sentence structure implies that ""she"" (Sonia) is the one rejecting the proposal, not the one making it.

Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Sonia in this context.",1,1
1493,"This resulted in Dr. McDonald continuously raping Dr. Pheobe, until she got caught.",she,"0: Dr. Trichelair, 1: Dr. McDonald, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Dr. McDonald, not Dr. Pheobe or an unmentioned Dr. Trichelair. The reasoning is as follows:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""she"" refers to the subject of the action (raping), which is Dr. McDonald.
2. The phrase ""until she got caught"" implies that the person who was doing the action (raping) was caught, not the victim.
3. Dr. Pheobe is mentioned as the object of the action (being raped), so it wouldn't make sense for ""she"" to refer to Dr. Pheobe in this context.
4. Dr. Trichelair is not mentioned in the given text at all, so there's no reason to believe ""she"" refers to this person.

Therefore, based on the context and grammatical structure of the sentence, ""she"" most likely refers to Dr. McDonald (candidate 1).",1,1
1494,"This resulted in Dr. McDonald continuously raping Dr. Pheobe, until she got pregnant.",she,"0: Dr. Trichelair, 1: Dr. McDonald, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" refers to Dr. Pheobe, who is mentioned as getting pregnant as a result of Dr. McDonald's actions. Neither Dr. Trichelair nor Dr. McDonald are appropriate referents for ""she"" in this context. Dr. McDonald is explicitly mentioned as male (using ""he"" pronouns), and Dr. Trichelair is not mentioned in the text at all. Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" does not refer to either of the given candidates.",1,2
1495,"Karl starts having visions of where Bobby is, seeing he is unconscious and stuck in a box.",he,"0: Karl, 1: Bobby, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""he"" refers to: Karl or Bobby. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Karl starts having visions...""
2. The visions are about ""where Bobby is""
3. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""seeing he is unconscious and stuck in a box""

Given this information, it's clear that ""he"" refers to Bobby, not Karl. Karl is the one having the visions, and he is seeing Bobby in these visions. The description of being ""unconscious and stuck in a box"" applies to Bobby, the person Karl is seeing in his vision.",1,1
1496,Sutton went on to campaign for Barack Obama after he secured the nomination.,he,"0: Sutton, 1: Barack Obama, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Barack Obama. The context suggests that Sutton campaigned for Obama after Obama secured the nomination. The phrase ""after he secured the nomination"" indicates that ""he"" is referring to the person who secured the nomination, which is Barack Obama, not Sutton.",0,1
1497,"Louise even proposed to Sami, but with a caveat: she had to promise to redeem herself and never lie to her again.",she,"0: Louise, 1: Sami, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Louise is the subject of the first part of the sentence, performing the action of proposing to Sami.
2. The pronoun ""she"" appears in the second part of the sentence, referring to someone who ""had to promise to redeem herself and never lie to her again.""

Given this context, it's more logical that Sami is the one who needs to make promises and redeem herself. If Louise was making the promises, it wouldn't make sense for her to propose with conditions on herself. Therefore, ""she"" in this sentence most likely refers to Sami.",1,1
1498,Albert begins wooing Leroy but he discovers that his brother Zak also has feelings for him.,his,"0: Albert, 1: Leroy, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""his"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Albert begins wooing Leroy.""
2. Then it says ""but he discovers"" - here, ""he"" likely refers to Albert, as he is the subject of the first part of the sentence.
3. The pronoun in question, ""his,"" appears in the phrase ""his brother Zak.""

Given this analysis, ""his"" is most likely referring to Albert for the following reasons:
- Albert is the main subject of the sentence.
- It's more logical that Albert would have a brother, rather than Leroy (who is being wooed) suddenly having a brother introduced in the sentence.
- The sentence is describing Albert's actions and discoveries, so it's natural that it would refer to Albert's brother.

Therefore, the pronoun ""his"" most likely refers to Albert.",0,0
1499,"Toby is transformed into a being resembling Jareth and when he returns to Mizumi, he declares his intention to tear down the Labyrinth and rebuild it.",he,"0: Toby, 1: Jareth, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun 'he' refers to Toby. The text states that 'Toby is transformed into a being resembling Jareth' and then continues with 'when he returns to Mizumi, he declares his intention...'. This sequence of events clearly indicates that 'he' is referring to Toby, who has undergone a transformation and is now taking action. The pronoun is used to avoid repeating Toby's name while describing his subsequent actions.",0,0
1500,"Shortly after, Samuel becomes infatuated with Ryan Lee but he is not interested in him on the same level.",he,"0: Samuel, 1: Ryan Lee, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Samuel becomes infatuated with Ryan Lee.
2. ""he"" is not interested in ""him"" on the same level.

Given this information, it's clear that ""he"" refers to Ryan Lee because:
- Samuel is the one who becomes infatuated.
- The pronoun ""he"" is used to describe someone who is not interested in the same way.
- ""him"" likely refers back to Samuel, as he is the one interested.

Therefore, ""he"" must be referring to Ryan Lee, who is not interested in Samuel on the same level.",1,1
1501,"This is, as Roarke dryly comments to Mark, because he has no real courage.",he,"0: Roarke, 1: Mark, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who the pronoun ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Roarke is making a comment to Mark.
2. The comment is about someone having ""no real courage.""
3. The pronoun ""he"" is used to refer to the person lacking courage.

Given that Roarke is making a comment about someone else to Mark, it's most likely that Roarke is referring to Mark as the person who has no real courage. It wouldn't make sense for Roarke to be commenting about himself in this way to Mark.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Mark.",0,1
1502,"Marilyn leaves Penelope from the Bay, but three years later she returns and reveals that they have separated.",she,"0: Marilyn, 1: Penelope, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" refers to Marilyn. We can determine this because:

1. Marilyn is the subject of the first part of the sentence, performing the action of leaving.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the second part of the sentence to describe someone returning and revealing information.
3. It makes logical sense that the person who left (Marilyn) would be the one to return and reveal information about a separation.

The pronoun ""she"" cannot refer to Penelope because Penelope is not described as performing any actions in the sentence. Additionally, it wouldn't make sense for Penelope to reveal information about a separation if she was the one being left.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Marilyn.",0,0
1503,"Melissa begins to court Yisselda, but she refuses to elope with her knowing that her father would not agree to their marriage.",she,"0: Melissa, 1: Yisselda, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Melissa begins to court Yisselda.""
2. The pronoun ""she"" appears in the clause ""but she refuses to elope with her.""
3. Logically, the person refusing to elope would be the one being courted, not the one doing the courting.
4. The sentence mentions ""her father,"" which is more likely to refer to Yisselda's father rather than Melissa's.

Based on these points, it's clear that ""she"" refers to Yisselda, as she is the one refusing to elope and whose father is mentioned in the context of not agreeing to the marriage.",1,1
1504,"Karla then reappears as a vision to Hayley when she attends the launch of Donald Fisher book, she helped illustrate.",she,"0: Karla, 1: Hayley, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Karla then reappears as a vision to Hayley...""
2. The pronoun ""she"" appears in the clause ""she helped illustrate.""
3. The book launch is being attended by Hayley.

Given this information, it's more likely that ""she"" refers to Hayley rather than Karla. The reason is:

1. Hayley is the one attending the book launch.
2. It makes more sense that Hayley helped illustrate the book, as Karla is described as appearing as a vision, suggesting she may not be physically present or alive.
3. The sentence structure places ""Hayley"" closer to the pronoun ""she,"" which is a common pattern in English for pronoun references.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Hayley.",1,1
1505,"Brenda does not give any description of Wendy, but she is generally depicted as a pretty girl with either blond or brown hair.",she,"0: Brenda, 1: Wendy, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine whether the pronoun ""she"" refers to Brenda, Wendy, or neither. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Brenda does not give any description of Wendy.""
2. Then it continues with ""but she is generally depicted as a pretty girl with either blond or brown hair.""

The key point here is that the second part of the sentence is providing a description of someone. Since the first part explicitly states that Brenda does not give any description of Wendy, it's logical to conclude that the description in the second part refers to Wendy herself, not Brenda.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" in this context most likely refers to Wendy.",1,1
1506,"Frank falls for Dillinger even after he reveals his identity, and the two become inseparable.",he,"0: Frank, 1: Dillinger, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Dillinger. The context suggests that Dillinger is revealing his identity to Frank, which implies that ""he"" is Dillinger. The sentence structure indicates that Frank is falling for Dillinger after this revelation, further confirming that ""he"" refers to Dillinger and not Frank.",1,1
1507,"Luke is ecstatic, but Pierre is concerned when he sees Thomas's ring.",he,"0: Luke, 1: Pierre, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Luke is described as ""ecstatic""
2. Pierre is described as ""concerned""
3. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the phrase ""when he sees Thomas's ring""

The pronoun ""he"" is more likely to refer to Pierre because:
1. Pierre is the subject of the second part of the sentence, which is closer to the pronoun ""he""
2. The action of seeing Thomas's ring is associated with being ""concerned,"" which matches Pierre's emotional state
3. It wouldn't make sense for Luke, who is ecstatic, to suddenly be concerned about seeing Thomas's ring

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Pierre.",1,1
1508,"Richard is later contacted by Ned himself; if he does not assist them, Shawn will be attacked as an enemy.",he,"0: Richard, 1: Ned, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Richard. The context suggests that Richard is being contacted by Ned, and the pronoun ""he"" is used in reference to Richard not assisting ""them"" (likely referring to Ned and his associates). The sentence is describing a situation where Richard is being pressured to assist, with consequences if he doesn't. Therefore, ""he"" in this context is most likely referring to Richard.",0,0
1509,"Roddy acts a lot like an older brother to Luke, especially when he tries to be overbearing on Ride.",he,"0: Roddy, 1: Luke, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions two male characters: Roddy and Luke.
2. The pronoun ""he"" appears in the clause ""when he tries to be overbearing on Ride.""
3. The main clause states that ""Roddy acts a lot like an older brother to Luke.""
4. The second clause, starting with ""especially,"" provides additional information about how Roddy acts like an older brother.
5. It's more logical that the person trying to be overbearing would be the one acting like an older brother.

Given this analysis, it's most likely that ""he"" refers to Roddy, as he is the one described as acting like an older brother, and the action of trying to be overbearing aligns with this description.",1,0
1510,The mourning Rachel then embarked on an affair with Jade after she comforted her and attended the funeral with her for support.,she,"0: Rachel, 1: Jade, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""she"" the pronoun refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence starts with ""The mourning Rachel,"" indicating that Rachel is the main subject.
2. It then mentions that Rachel ""embarked on an affair with Jade.""
3. The pronoun ""she"" appears twice in the latter part of the sentence: ""after she comforted her and attended the funeral with her for support.""

Given this context, it's more likely that Jade is the one doing the comforting and attending the funeral with Rachel for support. This interpretation makes sense because:

1. Rachel is described as ""mourning,"" suggesting she's the one who needs comfort.
2. The affair with Jade is mentioned as happening after the comforting and funeral attendance, implying that Jade's support led to their relationship.

Therefore, both instances of ""she"" in the latter part of the sentence most likely refer to Jade, not Rachel.",1,1
1511,Uddhava was famous as devotee and a dear friend of Krishna but even he could not fathom why he had not prevented the destruction from happening.,he,"0: Uddhava, 1: Krishna, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""he"" refers to: Uddhava or Krishna. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence starts by introducing Uddhava as a devotee and friend of Krishna.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""even he could not fathom why he had not prevented the destruction from happening.""
3. The use of ""even"" suggests that this person would be expected to understand or know something, but surprisingly doesn't.
4. Given that Uddhava is described as famous and a dear friend of Krishna, it makes more sense that Uddhava would be the one wondering about Krishna's actions.
5. It's unlikely that Krishna would be questioning his own actions in this context.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Uddhava, who couldn't understand why Krishna had not prevented the destruction.",1,0
1512,"Mark was placed in the care of Father Forthill, so he could find a safe place for him to live.",he,"0: Mark, 1: Father Forthill, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""he"" refers to: Mark or Father Forthill. Let's analyze the context:

1. Mark is the subject of the first part of the sentence.
2. Father Forthill is mentioned as the person Mark was placed in the care of.
3. The pronoun ""he"" appears in the clause ""so he could find a safe place for him to live.""

Given the structure of the sentence, it's more logical that Father Forthill would be the one finding a safe place for Mark to live, rather than Mark finding a safe place for himself. This interpretation makes more sense in the context of Mark being placed in Father Forthill's care.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Father Forthill.",1,1
1513,"This bishop intended to erect a seminary for the training of the clergyman, but a few obstacles frustrated his plan.",his,"0: This bishop, 1: the clergyman, 2: Neither","The pronoun ""his"" in this sentence refers to ""This bishop"" for the following reasons:

1. The sentence begins by introducing ""This bishop"" as the main subject.
2. The bishop is described as having an intention to erect a seminary, which implies a plan.
3. The pronoun ""his"" is used in reference to this plan.
4. ""The clergyman"" is mentioned as a general category of people who would be trained in the seminary, not as a specific individual with a plan.
5. It would not make sense for ""his plan"" to refer to ""the clergyman"" in this context, as the clergyman is not established as having a plan.

Therefore, the most logical and grammatically correct interpretation is that ""his"" refers to ""This bishop.""",0,0
1514,"Carrie is torn, but does love Harriet, so she decides to stay with her.",she,"0: Carrie, 1: Harriet, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which person the pronoun ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Carrie is torn,"" indicating that Carrie is the main subject.
2. The sentence then mentions that Carrie loves Harriet.
3. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the phrase ""she decides to stay with her.""

Given this information, we can conclude that ""she"" refers to Carrie for the following reasons:
1. Carrie is the subject of the sentence and the main actor.
2. The decision to ""stay with her"" implies that Carrie is making the decision to stay with Harriet.
3. It would not make sense for Harriet to decide to stay with herself.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Carrie.",0,0
1515,"Kuti does not remember when Margaryan returned, but early in the morning he felt that someone had turned on the light.",he,"0: Kuti, 1: Margaryan, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Kuti. The sentence structure suggests that Kuti is the subject experiencing the action of feeling that someone had turned on the light. The phrase ""he felt"" indicates that Kuti is the one who had this sensation. Margaryan is mentioned only in the context of Kuti not remembering when Margaryan returned, but is not the subject of the main action in the sentence.",1,0
1516,"Lee attended to Kearney, but he died of his wounds.",he,"0: Kearney, 1: Lee, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence mentions two people: Lee and Kearney.
2. Lee is described as attending to Kearney.
3. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""he died of his wounds.""

Given this information, it's more likely that ""he"" refers to Kearney for the following reasons:
1. Kearney is the object of Lee's attention, suggesting he might be in a condition that requires care.
2. The sentence structure implies a cause-and-effect relationship between Lee attending to Kearney and someone dying of wounds.
3. If Lee had died, it would be unusual for the sentence to mention him attending to Kearney first.

Therefore, the most logical interpretation is that Kearney is the one who died of his wounds, despite Lee's attempts to help him.",1,0
1517,"Hancock is a member of The Flatlanders along with Joe Ely, but he has principally performed solo.",he,"0: Hancock, 1: Joe Ely, 2: Neither","The pronoun ""he"" in this sentence refers to Hancock for the following reasons:

1. Hancock is mentioned first in the sentence, making him the primary subject.
2. The sentence structure suggests that the information after the comma is providing additional details about Hancock.
3. The phrase ""but he has principally performed solo"" is contrasting with the earlier information about Hancock being a member of The Flatlanders, indicating that ""he"" refers to the same person mentioned at the beginning of the sentence.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Hancock, not Joe Ely.",0,0
1518,"Pete flirts with a very receptive Jake, but when he asks about the circus's profits, he is furious and slaps him.",he,"0: Pete, 1: a very receptive Jake, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and the actions described in the sentence.

1. The sentence starts with ""Pete flirts with a very receptive Jake.""
2. Then it says ""but when he asks about the circus's profits"" - this ""he"" is likely referring to Pete, as he initiated the interaction and is more likely to be asking about profits.
3. The sentence continues with ""he is furious and slaps him"" - this suggests that the person asking about profits (Pete) becomes angry and slaps the other person (Jake).

Based on this analysis, it appears that both instances of ""he"" in the sentence refer to Pete. Pete is the one who asks about the circus's profits and then becomes furious and slaps Jake.",0,0
1519,"Nate will patiently wait for Bob, as he is off to join the Army and discovers that he ca n't quite get rid of Wilbur just yet.",he,"0: Nate, 1: Bob, 2: Neither","Let's analyze the sentence to determine who ""he"" refers to:

1. The sentence starts with ""Nate will patiently wait for Bob""
2. Then it says ""as he is off to join the Army""
3. The use of ""as"" suggests that the reason for Nate waiting is because someone is joining the Army
4. It's more logical that Bob is the one joining the Army, which is why Nate is waiting for him
5. The pronoun ""he"" is therefore most likely referring to Bob

Based on this reasoning, ""he"" appears to refer to Bob rather than Nate.",1,1
1520,"However, Toyotomi Hideyoshi ordered Koremitsu to be killed when he was thirteen years of age for unknown reasons.",he,"0: Koremitsu, 1: Toyotomi Hideyoshi, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions two individuals: Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Koremitsu.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""when he was thirteen years of age"".
3. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" refers to the person who was killed, not the person who ordered the killing.
4. Logically, it makes more sense that Koremitsu was thirteen years old when he was killed, rather than Toyotomi Hideyoshi being thirteen when he ordered the killing.

Based on these points, it is most likely that ""he"" refers to Koremitsu, who was killed at the age of thirteen.",0,0

1. Ppel is the subject of the sentence, performing the action of speaking to Victor.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the phrase ""he never loved him.""
3. Given the structure of the sentence, it's more likely that Ppel is expressing regret about never having loved Victor, rather than Victor never having loved Ppel.
4. The use of ""but remembering their good times"" further supports that Ppel is the one reflecting on the relationship.

Based on this analysis, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Ppel, as Ppel is the one expressing regret about never having loved Victor.",0,0
1522,"Karl is forever indebted to John Black, after he helps him deal with a drug addiction.",him,"0: Karl, 1: John Black, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who the pronoun ""him"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence structure suggests that someone is helping someone else.
2. Karl is the subject of the first part of the sentence, indicating he is receiving help.
3. John Black is mentioned as the person to whom Karl is indebted, implying that John Black is the one providing help.
4. The pronoun ""him"" is used in the context of receiving help with a drug addiction.

Given this analysis, it's most logical that ""him"" refers to Karl, as he is the one receiving help from John Black. John Black is the one providing the help, so he wouldn't be referred to as ""him"" in this context.",1,0
1523,"Houston agrees, but Patrick's parents are appalled when he asked them for permission.",he,"0: Houston, 1: Patrick, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" clearly refers to Patrick for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure indicates that Patrick is the subject of the second clause, where the pronoun ""he"" is used.
2. The context suggests that Patrick is the one asking his parents for permission, not Houston.
3. It wouldn't make sense for Houston to ask Patrick's parents for permission, further confirming that ""he"" refers to Patrick.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Patrick, which is candidate 1.",0,1
1524,Tina files a complaint against her boss Patricia Webster when she begins to sexually harass her.,she,"0: Tina, 1: her boss Patricia Webster, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions two people: Tina and Patricia Webster.
2. The pronoun ""she"" appears twice in the sentence.
3. The first ""she"" is the subject of the clause ""when she begins to sexually harass her.""
4. It's unlikely that Tina would be sexually harassing herself, so the first ""she"" most likely refers to Patricia Webster.
5. The second ""her"" in the sentence likely refers to Tina, as she is the one filing the complaint and would be the victim of harassment.

Given this analysis, we can conclude that the pronoun ""she"" in question refers to Patricia Webster, as she is the one who begins to sexually harass Tina.",0,1
1525,"Penny offers Bennett drugs, but before she can accept, O'olish Amaneh appears and takes them home.",she,"0: Penny, 1: Bennett, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" refers to Bennett. The context suggests that Penny is offering drugs to Bennett, and before Bennett can accept, O'olish Amaneh intervenes. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the phrase ""before she can accept,"" which logically refers to Bennett, as she is the one being offered the drugs and would be in the position to accept them.",0,1
1526,"Meanwhile, a weakened Megatron tries to regain command of the Decepticon, but Shockwave easily takes him down.",him,"0: a weakened Megatron, 1: the Decepticon, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""him"" clearly refers to Megatron. The context indicates that Megatron is in a weakened state and is trying to regain command of the Decepticons. The sentence then states that ""Shockwave easily takes him down,"" where ""him"" must be referring to Megatron, as he is the one being taken down. The Decepticon is mentioned as a group that Megatron is trying to command, not as an individual that could be taken down. Therefore, the pronoun ""him"" refers to ""a weakened Megatron"" (candidate 0).",0,0
1527,High Court Justice Christopher Clarke ruled that Cherney might be assassinated or held on trumped-up charges if he tried to bring the case in Russia.,he,"0: Cherney, 1: High Court Justice Christopher Clarke, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence is about a ruling made by High Court Justice Christopher Clarke.
2. The ruling concerns Cherney and the potential risks he might face in Russia.
3. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the phrase ""if he tried to bring the case in Russia.""

Given this context, it's clear that the pronoun ""he"" refers to Cherney, not to Justice Christopher Clarke. The sentence is discussing the potential consequences for Cherney if he were to pursue the case in Russia. It wouldn't make sense for the judge to be the one trying to bring the case to Russia.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Cherney, which is candidate 0.",1,0
1528,"Patrick decides to move on with Samuel when he proposes to him, and he accepts.",he,"0: Patrick, 1: Samuel, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""he"" refers to Patrick or Samuel. Let's break it down:

1. ""Patrick decides to move on with Samuel"" - This establishes Patrick as the main subject of the sentence.
2. ""when he proposes to him"" - This is where the first ""he"" appears. Given that Patrick is the main subject, it's most likely that Patrick is the one proposing.
3. ""and he accepts"" - This is the second ""he"" in the sentence. Since Patrick was likely the one proposing, it makes sense that Samuel is the one accepting the proposal.

The pronoun ""he"" in the question could refer to either of these instances. However, since the question asks about a single ""he"" without specifying which one, and the first ""he"" in the sentence is more prominent (being the subject of the main clause), it's more likely referring to Patrick.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Patrick.",0,0
1529,"Jack tries to detain Jerry, but he is presumed dead in an explosion.",he,"0: Jack, 1: Jerry, 2: Neither","To determine who ""he"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and the most logical interpretation:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" is the subject of ""is presumed dead in an explosion.""
2. The action described before the comma is ""Jack tries to detain Jerry.""
3. It's more likely that the person being detained (Jerry) would be the one presumed dead in an explosion, rather than the person doing the detaining (Jack).
4. If Jack were presumed dead, it would be odd to mention him trying to detain Jerry first, as that action would be less relevant to his presumed death.

Given these points, it's most logical to conclude that ""he"" refers to Jerry, as he is the one being detained and more likely to be involved in a situation leading to being presumed dead in an explosion.",1,1
1530,Mark walks in to find Harold and he immediately gets upset because he still does n't trust him.,he,"0: Mark, 1: Harold, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""he"" the pronoun refers to. Let's analyze the sentence:

1. Mark walks in to find Harold
2. ""he"" immediately gets upset
3. ""he"" still doesn't trust ""him""

The first ""he"" in the sentence is likely referring to Mark because:
1. Mark is the subject of the first clause and the one performing the action (walking in).
2. It's more natural for the person entering a situation to have an immediate reaction.

The second ""he"" and ""him"" in ""he still doesn't trust him"" are likely referring to Mark and Harold respectively:
1. Mark (the first ""he"") doesn't trust Harold (""him"").
2. The word ""still"" implies an ongoing lack of trust, which makes more sense if Mark is the one who doesn't trust Harold, rather than the other way around.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" in this sentence most likely refers to Mark.",0,0
1531,"Horatio does n't believe Poque and says that if his boat truly has the N word on it, he'll eat his hat.",his,"0: Horatio, 1: Poque, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""his"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Horatio is the subject of the sentence and the main actor.
2. The sentence mentions ""his boat"" and ""his hat.""
3. The context suggests that Horatio is the one who would eat his own hat if proven wrong.

Given these points, it's clear that ""his"" refers to Horatio in both instances. The boat and the hat belong to Horatio, and he's the one making the statement about eating his hat.",0,0
1532,"Meanwhile, Kyoko is trapped by the vengeful spirit of Li Li, but Naoto is able to bring her to safety.",her,"0: Kyoko, 1: Li Li, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""her"" most likely refers to Kyoko for the following reasons:

1. Kyoko is mentioned first in the sentence and is the main subject of the first clause.
2. The sentence structure indicates that Kyoko is the one who is trapped and needs to be brought to safety.
3. Naoto is described as bringing ""her"" to safety, which logically follows from Kyoko being trapped.
4. Li Li is mentioned as a ""vengeful spirit,"" which implies that she is not the one being rescued or brought to safety.

Therefore, the pronoun ""her"" in this context refers to Kyoko.",1,0
1533,"When Gary eventually ` comes out' to Samuel, he tells him he's known all along, since they were young kids.",he,"0: Gary, 1: Samuel, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""he"" refers to: Gary or Samuel. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence starts with ""When Gary eventually 'comes out' to Samuel...""
2. This implies that Gary is revealing something personal (likely his sexual orientation) to Samuel.
3. The sentence continues with ""he tells him he's known all along...""

Now, let's break down this part:
- The first ""he"" is the subject doing the telling, which logically would be Gary (the one who just came out).
- ""him"" refers to Samuel (the person being told).
- The second ""he"" is the one who has known all along.

It makes more sense in this context that Samuel would be the one who has known all along about Gary's sexual orientation, rather than Gary telling Samuel that Gary himself has known all along (which would be redundant given that Gary is coming out).

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" in question (the second ""he"" in the sentence) most likely refers to Samuel.",1,"1

1534,"Mark still wants to marry Johnny, but at the wedding his cowardice comes out once more.",his,"0: Mark, 1: Johnny, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""his"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions two people: Mark and Johnny.
2. The pronoun ""his"" is used in the phrase ""his cowardice comes out once more.""
3. The sentence structure suggests that ""his"" refers to the subject of the main clause, which is Mark.
4. It's more logical that Mark's cowardice would come out at the wedding, as he is the one who ""still wants to marry Johnny.""
5. The phrase ""once more"" implies that this cowardice has been displayed before, which is more likely to be associated with Mark, who is portrayed as the main actor in this sentence.

Based on these observations, it's most probable that ""his"" refers to Mark.",1,0
1535,"Luke agrees to spend some time on the road with Norman, even though he becomes physically and emotionally abusive to him.",he,"0: Luke, 1: Norman, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions two people: Luke and Norman.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""even though he becomes physically and emotionally abusive to him.""
3. The structure of the sentence suggests that Luke is the subject who agrees to spend time with Norman.
4. The pronoun ""he"" is then used to describe someone who becomes abusive.
5. The phrase ""abusive to him"" implies that the abuser and the victim are different people.

Given this analysis, it's more likely that ""he"" refers to Norman, as he is the one being described as abusive towards Luke (referred to as ""him"" in the latter part of the sentence).",1,1
1536,"Reese tries to run to save Malley, but Dobbs tries to stop him.",him,"0: Reese, 1: Malley, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""him"" refers to Reese. We can determine this because:

1. The sentence structure indicates that Reese is the one trying to run to save Malley.
2. Dobbs is then trying to stop someone, and that someone is referred to as ""him.""
3. Logically, Dobbs would be trying to stop Reese from running to save Malley, not trying to stop Malley (who is presumably in some kind of danger or trouble).

Therefore, ""him"" in this context refers to Reese, not Malley or any other person not mentioned in the text.",0,0

The sentence structure indicates that the AFL fan became aware of Dickfos when Dickfos made appearances in State of Origin matches. The pronoun ""he"" is used to describe the actions of Dickfos (making appearances and impressing for Queensland), not the actions of the AFL fan. Therefore, the correct referent for the pronoun ""he"" is Dickfos.",0,0
1538,"The Cutters attempt to capture the girls, but they escape on a hoverboard with David's help.",they,"0: the girls, 1: The Cutters, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""The Cutters attempt to capture the girls""
2. This is followed by ""but they escape""

The pronoun ""they"" is used in the context of escaping, which logically refers to the girls who were being captured. The Cutters are the ones attempting to capture, so it wouldn't make sense for them to be escaping.

Therefore, ""they"" most likely refers to ""the girls"" in this sentence.",0,0
1539,"Michelle treats Janey badly, but the worse she treats her the more she loves her.",she,"0: Michelle, 1: Janey, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""she"" the pronoun refers to. Let's break it down:

1. ""Michelle treats Janey badly"" - This establishes the initial relationship between Michelle and Janey.
2. ""but the worse she treats her"" - This ""she"" likely refers to Michelle, as she was the subject of the first clause and is the one doing the treating.
3. ""the more she loves her"" - This ""she"" is more ambiguous, but given the context, it's more likely to refer to Janey.

The sentence structure suggests that Michelle is the one treating Janey badly, and despite this bad treatment, Janey's love for Michelle increases. This interpretation makes the most logical sense in the context of human relationships.

Therefore, the first ""she"" in the pronoun field likely refers to Michelle (candidate 0).",0,0
1540,Anthony Bassett never saw Cassidy again after he first disappeared in South America.,he,"0: Cassidy, 1: Anthony Bassett, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions two people: Anthony Bassett and Cassidy.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the phrase ""after he first disappeared in South America.""
3. The sentence structure suggests that Anthony Bassett is the subject who never saw Cassidy again.
4. The disappearance is attributed to the person Anthony Bassett never saw again, which is Cassidy.

Based on this analysis, it's clear that ""he"" refers to Cassidy, as he is the one who disappeared in South America. Anthony Bassett is the one who never saw Cassidy again, so he cannot be the one who disappeared.",1,0

1. The sentence mentions two people: Bernadette and Cassie.
2. Bernadette is described as ""ailing"" and falling for Cassie.
3. The pronoun ""her"" appears in the phrase ""to see her in a setting outside the hospital.""

Given this context, it's clear that Bernadette is the one striving to get better. The goal of getting better is ""to see her in a setting outside the hospital."" Since Bernadette is the one trying to improve her health, ""her"" must refer to the person she wants to see, which is Cassie.

Therefore, the pronoun ""her"" refers to Cassie.",1,1

Given this information, it's clear that ""she"" refers to Sidana, not Morgana. Morgana is trying to save someone, and that someone (Sidana) is the one who dies. It wouldn't make sense for Morgana to be trying to save herself and then die instantly.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" refers to Sidana.",1,1
1543,"Patricia is very protective of Lynette because of her being shot in the arm at the store, and she wont let her go to the supermarket.",her,"0: Patricia, 1: Lynette, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""her"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

2. The reason for this protectiveness is stated as ""because of her being shot in the arm at the store.""
3. The pronoun ""her"" in this context refers to the person who was shot in the arm.
4. The sentence then continues with ""and she won't let her go to the supermarket,"" implying that the person who was shot is being prevented from going to the supermarket.

1. The sentence starts with ""Jubilant, Gandhi tries to reach Ram Mohan Rao...""

The pronoun ""he"" is more likely to refer to Ram Mohan Rao for the following reasons:
1. Ram Mohan Rao is the object of Gandhi's action (trying to reach).

1547,Jesus was taking care of Mackinnon when he was injured in the hospital.,he,"0: Jesus, 1: Mackinnon, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence structure suggests that Jesus is the subject performing the action of ""taking care of Mackinnon.""
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the subordinate clause ""when he was injured in the hospital.""
3. Logically, it makes more sense that Mackinnon was the one injured in the hospital, as Jesus is described as taking care of someone.
4. It's more likely that Jesus would be taking care of Mackinnon while Mackinnon was injured, rather than Jesus being injured while taking care of Mackinnon.

Based on this analysis, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Mackinnon, as he is the one who was injured and being taken care of in the hospital.",1,1
1548,"Samuel agrees to marry Mr. Bellmann, but on the condition that he has to give Mackinnon the money for his client.",he,"0: Samuel, 1: Mr. Bellmann, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Samuel agrees to marry Mr. Bellmann.""
2. The condition is introduced with ""but on the condition that...""
3. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the condition clause.

Given this structure, it's more likely that ""he"" refers to Mr. Bellmann rather than Samuel. The condition is being placed on Mr. Bellmann as part of the agreement to marry. It would make more sense for Samuel to place a condition on Mr. Bellmann (the person he's agreeing to marry) rather than on himself.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Mr. Bellmann (candidate 1).",1,1
1549,Now Parker is very upset with Carl and after another series of events he runs away.,he,"0: Parker, 1: Carl, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""he"" refers to - Parker or Carl. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Now Parker is very upset with Carl.""
2. It then mentions ""after another series of events he runs away.""

The pronoun ""he"" is more likely to refer to Parker for the following reasons:
1. Parker is mentioned first in the sentence, making him the primary subject.
2. Parker is described as being ""very upset with Carl,"" which provides a motive for the subsequent action of running away.
3. It's more logical for the person who is upset (Parker) to be the one who runs away, rather than the person who caused the upset (Carl).

Therefore, based on the context and the flow of the sentence, ""he"" most likely refers to Parker.",0,0
1550,"Danielle once again tried flirting with Jasmine, but she refuses to go any further than having a few drinks with her, and turned her down.",she,"0: Danielle, 1: Jasmine, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Jasmine. The context suggests that Danielle is the one doing the flirting, while Jasmine is the one refusing to go further and turning Danielle down. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""she refuses to go any further,"" which describes the actions of the person being flirted with, not the one doing the flirting. Therefore, ""she"" in this context refers to Jasmine.",1,1
1551,Hiranyakasipu banished Prahlada but then he relented and allowed him to come home.,him,"0: Hiranyakasipu, 1: Prahlada, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""him"" refers to, let's analyze the sentence:

""Hiranyakasipu banished Prahlada but then he relented and allowed him to come home.""

1. The pronoun ""him"" is used in the object position of the sentence.
2. The subject of the action ""allowed"" is ""he,"" which refers back to Hiranyakasipu (the subject of the first clause).
3. Logically, Hiranyakasipu would not allow himself to come home, so ""him"" must refer to someone else.
4. Prahlada is the only other person mentioned in the sentence and is the logical recipient of the action ""allowed to come home.""

Therefore, the pronoun ""him"" refers to Prahlada.",0,1
1552,"Anna tries again to live with Karla, but she can not get Vronsky out of her head.",her,"0: Anna, 1: Karla, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""her"" most likely refers to Anna for the following reasons:

1. Anna is the subject of the main clause and the first person mentioned, making her the primary focus of the sentence.
2. The sentence structure suggests that ""she"" (which also refers to Anna) is the one who can't get Vronsky out of ""her"" head.
3. The context implies that Anna is the one struggling with thoughts of Vronsky, as she is trying to live with Karla again but is having difficulty due to these thoughts.
4. Karla is mentioned only as a secondary character in the sentence, and there's no indication that she is the one thinking about Vronsky.

Therefore, it is most logical to conclude that ""her"" refers to Anna in this context.",0,0
1553,"Monique tries to find Jade, but an enraged Fidel warns her to stay away.",her,"0: Monique, 1: Jade, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who the pronoun ""her"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Monique is the subject of the sentence, trying to find Jade.
2. Fidel warns ""her"" to stay away.

Given this information, it's most logical that Fidel is warning Monique to stay away, not Jade. This is because:

1. Monique is the active character in the sentence, performing the action of trying to find Jade.
2. It wouldn't make sense for Fidel to warn Jade to stay away when Monique is the one searching for her.
3. The pronoun ""her"" is used in the context of someone being warned, which aligns with Monique's action of trying to find Jade.

Therefore, the pronoun ""her"" most likely refers to Monique.",0,0
1554,Gauri decides to separate from Samantha when she sees that she does n't trust her anymore.,she,"0: Gauri, 1: Samantha, 2: Neither","In this sentence, there are multiple instances of the pronoun ""she"". Let's analyze them one by one:

1. ""when she sees"": This ""she"" likely refers to Gauri, as Gauri is the subject of the main clause and is making the decision to separate.

2. ""she doesn't trust"": This ""she"" is ambiguous. It could refer to either Gauri not trusting Samantha, or Samantha not trusting Gauri.

3. ""trust her"": This ""her"" likely refers to the other person in the relationship, opposite to whoever is doing the not trusting.

Given the structure of the sentence, it's more likely that Gauri is the one who sees that Samantha doesn't trust her (Gauri) anymore. This interpretation makes the most sense in the context of Gauri deciding to separate.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" in this sentence most likely refers to Gauri.",0,0
1555,Elly was told by Joanne to stop worrying so much about her father and that they will welcome Iris.,her,"0: Elly, 1: Joanne, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""her"" is most likely referring to Elly's father, not Elly or Joanne. The context suggests that Elly is worrying about her own father, and Joanne is telling Elly to stop worrying about him. 

The pronoun ""her"" is used in the phrase ""her father,"" which implies a possessive relationship. Since Elly is the subject of the sentence and the one being told to stop worrying, it's logical that the father being referred to is Elly's father.

Neither Elly nor Joanne is the direct referent of the pronoun ""her"" in this context. Therefore, the correct answer is ""Neither.""",0,2
1556,Jade asks Estelle to call if she encounters any more fairies.,she,"0: Jade, 1: Estelle, 2: Neither","To determine who ""she"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and the logical flow of the sentence.

1. Jade is the subject of the sentence, performing the action of asking.
2. Estelle is the object, being asked to do something.
3. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the context of encountering fairies.

Given the structure of the sentence, it's more likely that ""she"" refers to Estelle rather than Jade. This is because:

1. Jade is asking Estelle to call, implying that Estelle might be the one to encounter fairies.
2. It would be unusual for Jade to ask Estelle to call if Jade herself encounters fairies.
3. The pronoun ""she"" is closer to Estelle in the sentence, which often (but not always) indicates the referent.

Therefore, the most logical conclusion is that ""she"" refers to Estelle.",1,1
1557,"Infuriated, Daisy had Rufina strangled or beheaded and her body burned.",her,"0: Rufina, 1: Daisy, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine whether the pronoun ""her"" refers to Rufina or Daisy. Let's analyze the context:

1. Daisy is the subject of the sentence and the one performing the action.
2. Rufina is the object of the sentence and the one receiving the action.
3. The pronoun ""her"" is used in the phrase ""her body burned.""

Given this information, it's clear that ""her"" refers to Rufina for the following reasons:
- The body being burned is most likely the body of the person who was strangled or beheaded, which is Rufina.
- It wouldn't make sense for Daisy to have her own body burned while she's the one ordering the action.

Therefore, the pronoun ""her"" refers to Rufina (candidate 0).",0,0
1558,"Carcetti is dubious about working with Davis, but Wilson convinces him that it may tip the balance.",him,"0: Carcetti, 1: Davis, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""him"" refers to Carcetti. The sentence structure indicates that Wilson is convincing Carcetti about working with Davis. Carcetti is the subject of the first clause and is the one who is dubious about working with Davis. It makes logical sense that Wilson would be trying to convince Carcetti, not Davis, about the potential benefits of their collaboration.",1,0
1559,Daisy can not resist Kate sexually but she does not trust her.,her,"0: Kate, 1: Daisy, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""her"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence is about Daisy's feelings towards Kate.
2. Daisy is the subject of the sentence, and Kate is the object.
3. The pronoun ""her"" appears at the end of the sentence in the phrase ""she does not trust her.""

In English, when a pronoun is used in this way, it typically refers to the person who is not the subject of the sentence. In this case, ""she"" refers to Daisy (the subject), so ""her"" must refer to Kate.

Therefore, the pronoun ""her"" refers to Kate.",0,0
1560,"Michelle tries to stop Jessica, but she ends up inadvertently pushing her into a rock wall.",she,"0: Michelle, 1: Jessica, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Michelle tries to stop Jessica"".
2. Then it continues with ""but she ends up inadvertently pushing her"".

The pronoun ""she"" in this context refers to the subject of the action that follows, which is ""ends up inadvertently pushing"". Logically, this action is a continuation of Michelle's attempt to stop Jessica. It wouldn't make sense for Jessica to be pushing herself into a rock wall.

Therefore, ""she"" in this sentence refers to Michelle, who is trying to stop Jessica but accidentally pushes her instead.",1,0
1561,Rachel breaks up with Naomi after discovering that she stole her ID card.,she,"0: Rachel, 1: Naomi, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the context of stealing an ID card. Let's analyze the sentence:

1. Rachel breaks up with Naomi
2. The reason for breaking up is that ""she stole her ID card""

Given this information, it's more logical that Naomi is the one who stole Rachel's ID card, rather than Rachel stealing her own ID card. This makes sense as a reason for Rachel to break up with Naomi.

Therefore, ""she"" in this context most likely refers to Naomi.",1,1
1562,"Amy dives in to save Betty, but she goes under, where she begins to imagine she's a mermaid.",she,"0: Amy, 1: Betty, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. ""Amy dives in to save Betty"" - This establishes that Amy is the active character, trying to save Betty.

2. ""but she goes under"" - This ""she"" is more likely to refer to Betty, as Amy was diving in to save her. It wouldn't make sense for Amy to go under if she's the one doing the saving.

3. ""where she begins to imagine she's a mermaid"" - This ""she"" is referring to the same person who went under. 

Given this analysis, it's most logical that both instances of ""she"" in this sentence refer to Betty. Betty is the one who goes under and begins to imagine she's a mermaid, while Amy is trying to save her.",1,1
1563,"Alphonse decides to kill Zack, but he suddenly realizes that he is in fact his long-lost elder brother, and that consequently he is unable to kill him.",he,"0: Alphonse, 1: Zack, 2: Neither","In this sentence, there are two instances of 'he' that we need to consider. Let's analyze them one by one:

1. The first 'he' in '...he suddenly realizes...' refers to Alphonse. This is because Alphonse is the subject of the main clause and the one making the realization.

2. The second 'he' in '...he is in fact his long-lost elder brother...' also refers to Alphonse. This is because it's still part of Alphonse's realization about himself.

3. The third 'he' in '...he is unable to kill him' again refers to Alphonse. This is because Alphonse is the one who was initially planning to kill Zack and is now unable to do so.

Since the question doesn't specify which 'he' we're focusing on, and all instances of 'he' in this sentence refer to Alphonse, the correct answer is Alphonse.",0,0
1564,The doctor asks Bugs if he drank the potion; he becomes insulted at the idea and leaves.,he,"0: Bugs, 1: The doctor, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""he"" refers to: Bugs or the doctor. Let's analyze the context:

1. The doctor asks Bugs a question.
2. ""he becomes insulted at the idea and leaves.""

The pronoun ""he"" is more likely to refer to Bugs for the following reasons:
1. Bugs is the one being asked about drinking the potion, so he would be the one to react to the question.
2. The action of becoming insulted and leaving is a response to the doctor's question, which makes more sense coming from Bugs than from the doctor.
3. Grammatically, ""he"" is closer to ""Bugs"" in the sentence structure, making it the more natural antecedent.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Bugs.",1,0
1565,"Gwalchmai tries to leave with Rob, but Morgawse stands in his way.",his,"0: Gwalchmai, 1: Rob, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""his"" most likely refers to Gwalchmai. The sentence structure suggests that Gwalchmai is the main subject who is trying to leave with Rob. The pronoun ""his"" is used in the phrase ""in his way,"" which implies that Morgawse is blocking Gwalchmai's path. It's more natural to interpret this as Morgawse blocking Gwalchmai, who is the primary actor in the sentence, rather than Rob, who is mentioned secondarily.",0,0
1566,"Bobby broke off this engagement with Jack after deciding that he wanted to marry his ex-wife, Pam.",he,"0: Bobby, 1: Jack, 2: Neither","To determine who ""he"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and the logical flow of the information provided.

1. The sentence starts with ""Bobby broke off this engagement with Jack.""
2. Then it continues with ""after deciding that he wanted to marry his ex-wife, Pam.""

The pronoun ""he"" is used in reference to the person who made the decision to marry their ex-wife. Given the structure of the sentence, it's more logical that Bobby is the one who made this decision, as he is the subject of the main clause and the one who initiated the action of breaking off the engagement.

It wouldn't make sense for Jack to be the one referred to by ""he"" in this context, as Jack is not the one breaking off the engagement, and the sentence is primarily about Bobby's actions and decisions.

Therefore, ""he"" most likely refers to Bobby.",0,0
1567,"Rachel kidnapped Kay after she returned from chaperoning at the prom, and tied her up in a motel room.",she,"0: Rachel, 1: Kay, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence describes two actions: kidnapping and returning from chaperoning.
2. ""She"" is used in the clause ""after she returned from chaperoning at the prom.""
3. Chaperoning at a prom is typically done by adults or teachers, not students.
4. Rachel is the subject of the main clause and the one performing the action of kidnapping.
5. Kay is the object of the kidnapping action.

Given this information, it's more likely that Rachel was the one chaperoning at the prom and then returned. The pronoun ""she"" refers to Rachel in this context. Kay is presented as the victim of the kidnapping, and there's no indication that she was chaperoning.",1,0
1568,"Ms. Jones wishes to marry Princess Ingigerd, but she puts her off by pointing out that her father has not yet been avenged.",she,"0: Princess Ingigerd, 1: Ms. Jones, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Ms. Jones wishes to marry Princess Ingigerd
2. ""she"" puts her off
3. ""she"" points out that her father has not yet been avenged

Given this information, it's more likely that ""she"" refers to Princess Ingigerd for the following reasons:

1. Princess Ingigerd is the last mentioned person before the pronoun ""she"", making her the most recent subject.
2. It's more logical that Princess Ingigerd would be the one to put off the marriage, as she's the one being proposed to.
3. The mention of ""her father"" being avenged is more likely to refer to Princess Ingigerd's father, as royalty (princesses) are more commonly associated with matters of vengeance and family honor in traditional narratives.

Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Princess Ingigerd.",1,0
1569,Van Alen had failed to hire with Walter Chrysler when he received the Chrysler Building commission.,he,"0: Van Alen, 1: Walter Chrysler, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Van Alen. The sentence structure indicates that Van Alen is the subject who had failed to hire Walter Chrysler. The pronoun ""he"" is used to continue referring to Van Alen in the latter part of the sentence, where it states that he (Van Alen) received the Chrysler Building commission. Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" clearly refers to Van Alen, who is the first candidate in the list.",0,0
1570,"Kazushi kills Yoshio after he finds him unconscious, and then comes upon Takako Chigusa.",him,"0: Kazushi, 1: Yoshio, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""him"" refers to Yoshio. The sequence of events described is:

1. Kazushi finds someone unconscious (this is Yoshio)
2. Kazushi kills this unconscious person (Yoshio)
3. Kazushi then comes upon Takako Chigusa

The pronoun ""him"" is used in the context of Kazushi finding someone unconscious. Since Kazushi is the subject performing the action (finding and killing), ""him"" must refer to the object of these actions, which is Yoshio. Therefore, the pronoun ""him"" refers to Yoshio, which corresponds to candidate 1.",1,1
1571,"Strashun was offered the rabbinate of Suwaki, but he refused it, preferring to retain his independence.",he,"0: Strashun, 1: Suwaki, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" clearly refers to Strashun. The sentence is describing actions and decisions made by Strashun: he was offered a position (the rabbinate of Suwaki) and he refused it. The pronoun ""he"" is used to continue referring to Strashun in the second part of the sentence. Suwaki is a place, not a person, so it cannot be the referent of ""he"". Therefore, the correct answer is 0, referring to Strashun.",0,0
1572,Matisyahu met NYU film student Terry when he interviewed him for a documentary about men and women not touching.,he,"0: Matisyahu, 1: NYU film student Terry, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions two people: Matisyahu and Terry (NYU film student).
2. The pronoun ""he"" appears in the phrase ""when he interviewed him.""
3. The subject of the sentence is Matisyahu, who ""met NYU film student Terry.""
4. The action of interviewing is more likely to be performed by the film student, as they are making a documentary.
5. Therefore, ""he"" in this context refers to Terry, who interviewed Matisyahu for the documentary.

Based on this analysis, the pronoun ""he"" refers to the NYU film student Terry.",1,1
1573,Carly breaks up with Jade when she finds out she went to England to help Brenda.,she,"0: Carly, 1: Jade, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Carly breaks up with Jade.""
2. This is followed by ""when she finds out...""
3. The pronoun ""she"" in this context is more likely to refer to Carly, as she is the subject of the main clause and the one performing the action of breaking up.
4. The sentence continues with ""she went to England to help Brenda.""
5. This second ""she"" is more likely to refer to Jade, as it describes an action that prompted Carly to break up with her.

However, the question specifically asks about the first instance of ""she"" in the sentence. Therefore, based on the sentence structure and the logical flow of events, the pronoun ""she"" in ""when she finds out"" most likely refers to Carly.",0,0
1574,"Patricia begins dating Dr. Britt Westbourne, but she breaks up with her when he realizes she has been treating a patient poorly.",her,"0: Patricia, 1: Dr. Britt Westbourne, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which candidate the pronoun ""her"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Patricia is the subject of the sentence and is dating Dr. Britt Westbourne.
2. The pronoun ""her"" is used in the phrase ""breaks up with her.""
3. The next part of the sentence uses ""he,"" which implies that Dr. Britt Westbourne is male.

Given this information, we can conclude that ""her"" refers to Patricia. Patricia is the one being broken up with, and since Dr. Britt Westbourne is referred to as ""he"" later in the sentence, ""her"" cannot be referring to Dr. Britt Westbourne.",1,0
1575,"Anxiously, Jennifer attempts to hide from Victoria but she is caught before she could walk out from her.",she,"0: Victoria, 1: Jennifer, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""she"" refers to Jennifer or Victoria. Let's analyze the context:

1. Jennifer is trying to hide from Victoria.
2. ""She is caught"" - This likely refers to Jennifer, as she's the one trying to hide and therefore would be the one caught.
3. ""Before she could walk out from her"" - This also suggests that Jennifer (the one hiding) is trying to walk away from Victoria.

Both instances of ""she"" in this sentence appear to refer to Jennifer. The first ""she"" is clearly Jennifer being caught, and the second ""she"" is also Jennifer trying to walk away. Victoria is the one Jennifer is hiding from and trying to avoid, so it makes sense that Jennifer is the subject of these actions.",1,1
1576,"Geraci swears revenge against Michael, staying quiet until he can hatch a plan to defeat him.",he,"0: Geraci, 1: Michael, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which person the pronoun ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Geraci is the subject of the sentence and the main actor.
2. Geraci is described as swearing revenge against Michael.
3. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""until he can hatch a plan to defeat him.""

Given this information, it's clear that ""he"" refers to Geraci for the following reasons:
- Geraci is the one who swears revenge, so it makes sense that he would be the one hatching a plan.
- The sentence structure indicates that the subject (Geraci) is continuing an action (staying quiet) with a purpose (to hatch a plan).
- The use of ""him"" at the end of the sentence refers to Michael, further confirming that ""he"" must refer to Geraci.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Geraci, which is candidate 0.",1,0
1577,"Belinda tried to find Megan's sister Sarah, but she was kidnapped and believed killed.",she,"0: Belinda, 1: Megan 's sister Sarah, 2: Neither","To determine who ""she"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and the most logical interpretation:

1. The sentence mentions three people: Belinda, Megan, and Sarah (Megan's sister).
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""she was kidnapped and believed killed.""
3. The main action of the sentence is Belinda trying to find Sarah.
4. It wouldn't make sense for Belinda to be looking for Sarah if Belinda herself was kidnapped.
5. The most logical interpretation is that Sarah (Megan's sister) is the one who was kidnapped and believed killed, which explains why Belinda was trying to find her.

Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Sarah, who is part of the candidate ""Megan's sister Sarah.""",1,1
1578,"Walter assured Oliver that even though Dru's conception was not planned, he loved him regardless and had no regrets over having him.",he,"0: Walter, 1: Oliver, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""he"" the pronoun refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Walter is assuring Oliver about something.
2. The topic is about Dru's conception and love.
3. The pronoun ""he"" is used twice in the latter part of the sentence: ""he loved him regardless and had no regrets over having him.""

Given this context, it's clear that Walter is the one doing the assuring and expressing love. The ""he"" in both instances refers to Walter, as he is the one loving and having no regrets. Oliver is the one being assured and loved, referred to as ""him"" in the sentence.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" in this context refers to Walter.",0,0
1579,Delilah was finally rid of Susan when she became interested in Dr. Bruce Baxter.,she,"0: Delilah, 1: Susan, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Delilah was finally rid of Susan.""
2. This is followed by ""when she became interested in Dr. Bruce Baxter.""

The pronoun ""she"" is more likely to refer to Susan for the following reasons:
1. The sentence structure suggests a change in the situation involving both Delilah and Susan.
2. The phrase ""finally rid of"" implies that Delilah no longer had to deal with Susan.
3. The reason for this change is that ""she became interested in Dr. Bruce Baxter.""
4. It makes more logical sense that Susan becoming interested in someone else would result in Delilah being ""rid of"" her, rather than Delilah becoming interested in someone else.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Susan.",1,1
1580,"The men try to take care of the babies, but they become a huge pain.",they,"0: The men, 1: the babies, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence has two main parts: ""The men try to take care of the babies"" and ""but they become a huge pain.""
2. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the second part of the sentence.
3. Logically, it's more likely that the babies become a huge pain rather than the men becoming a huge pain while trying to take care of the babies.
4. The structure ""but they"" suggests a contrast to the previous clause, implying that despite the men's efforts, the babies are causing difficulties.
5. It's more natural and common to describe babies as becoming ""a huge pain"" in the context of caregiving, rather than the caregivers themselves.

Based on these points, it's most likely that ""they"" refers to ""the babies"" rather than ""The men.""",1,1
1581,"Rose's former fiance Julie Wilmot arrives to see Rose, but she is out on the buses.",she,"0: Rose, 1: Rose 's former fiance Julie Wilmot, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Rose is mentioned first, establishing her as the primary subject.
2. Julie Wilmot is introduced as Rose's former fiance, who arrives to see Rose.
3. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""but she is out on the buses.""

Given this information, it's more logical that ""she"" refers to Rose for the following reasons:
- The sentence is primarily about Rose, with Julie being introduced in relation to her.
- It makes more sense that Rose, who lives there, would be ""out on the buses"" rather than Julie, who has just arrived to see Rose.
- If ""she"" referred to Julie, the sentence would be contradictory, as it would imply Julie arrived but was also out on the buses.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Rose.",0,0
1582,"Veronica pleas her loyalty to Patricia, although soon afterward, she goes back to Logan.",she,"0: Veronica, 1: Patricia, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Veronica pleas her loyalty to Patricia.""
2. Then it continues with ""although soon afterward, she goes back to Logan.""

The pronoun ""she"" is more likely to refer to Veronica for the following reasons:
1. Veronica is the subject of the first part of the sentence, making her the primary focus.
2. The action of ""going back to Logan"" implies a previous relationship or connection, which is more likely to be associated with Veronica than Patricia.
3. The structure of the sentence suggests that the subject (Veronica) is continuing her actions throughout the sentence.

Therefore, it is most logical that ""she"" refers to Veronica in this context.",0,0
1583,Juan Pablo is forced to save Greenlee when an Argentinian gang targets him and Carlos.,him,"0: Greenlee, 1: Juan Pablo, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""him"" refers to Juan Pablo for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure suggests that Juan Pablo is the main subject of the action.
2. The pronoun ""him"" is used in conjunction with ""Carlos"" as targets of the Argentinian gang.
3. Greenlee is mentioned as someone Juan Pablo has to save, indicating that Greenlee is not the target (him) in this context.
4. It's more logical for the gang to target Juan Pablo (presumably male) rather than Greenlee (likely female, based on the name).

Therefore, the pronoun ""him"" most likely refers to Juan Pablo.",1,1
1584,"Robbie is falsely accused by Nate, but after hugging him and recognizing the smell of his aftershave, he realizes it was Finn.",him,"0: Robbie, 1: Nate, 2: Neither","In the given text, the pronoun 'him' refers to Nate. The sentence structure suggests that Robbie is hugging someone, and that someone is Nate. This is evident from the context where Robbie is falsely accused by Nate, and then there's an action of hugging 'him'. The 'him' in this case logically refers to Nate, as Robbie wouldn't be hugging himself, and Finn is only mentioned at the end as a realization. Therefore, the pronoun 'him' most likely refers to Nate.",0,1
1585,"Radu appeared to be killed by Brother Paulo, but he reappears a short while later injured, but alive.",he,"0: Radu, 1: Brother Paulo, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Radu for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure indicates that Radu is the main subject of the sentence.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""he reappears a short while later,"" which logically follows the information about Radu appearing to be killed.
3. The sentence describes Radu's status changing from seemingly dead to injured but alive, which aligns with the action of reappearing.
4. Brother Paulo is mentioned only as the apparent killer, not as someone who reappears or is injured.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Radu.",0,0
1586,Jacqueline then secretly sees Lola but she is scared of her and tells her not to go near Lexi.,she,"0: Jacqueline, 1: Lola, 2: Neither","In the given sentence, the pronoun 'she' appears twice. Let's analyze each occurrence:

1. 'she is scared of her': In this part, 'she' likely refers to Jacqueline because the sentence structure suggests that Jacqueline is the one seeing Lola, and then being scared of her. It wouldn't make sense for Lola to be scared of herself.

2. 'tells her not to go near Lexi': This 'her' refers to Lola, as Jacqueline is telling Lola not to go near Lexi.

Given that the question asks specifically about the pronoun 'she', we can conclude that 'she' refers to Jacqueline in this context.",1,0
1587,"After finding the parent asleep while looking after Lucas, Mike takes him.",him,"0: Lucas, 1: the parent, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""him"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence mentions two people: Lucas and the parent.
2. Mike is the subject of the main clause, performing the action of ""taking.""
3. The pronoun ""him"" is the object of the verb ""takes.""
4. The parent is described as ""asleep,"" which makes them less likely to be the one being taken.
5. Lucas is mentioned as being looked after, which implies he's a child or someone in need of care.

Given this information, it's most logical that Mike would take Lucas, not the sleeping parent. The pronoun ""him"" is more likely to refer to Lucas in this context.",0,0
1588,"Juno sends Alexa away, so that she can properly plot her revenge.",she,"0: Juno, 1: Alexa, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence has two subjects: Juno and Alexa.
2. Juno is the main subject performing the action of sending Alexa away.
3. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the subordinate clause ""so that she can properly plot her revenge.""
4. Logically, the person plotting revenge would be the one who sent the other away, not the one being sent away.
5. Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Juno, as she is the one who would be plotting revenge after sending Alexa away.

Based on this analysis, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Juno.",1,0
1589,"Daisy is always proud of Nancy when she has solved, and finished a case.",she,"0: Nancy, 1: Daisy, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence mentions two people: Daisy and Nancy.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""when she has solved, and finished a case.""
3. The sentence structure suggests that Daisy is proud of Nancy for an accomplishment.
4. Solving and finishing a case is typically associated with detective or investigative work.
5. The accomplishment (solving a case) is more likely to be attributed to Nancy, as Daisy is described as being proud of her.

Based on this analysis, it's more logical that ""she"" refers to Nancy, as she is the one who has likely solved and finished the case, which makes Daisy proud.",0,0
1590,"Dorothy passed by Daisy on the straight, but she re-took the lead by barging through the inside of the hairpin.",she,"0: Dorothy, 1: Daisy, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. ""Dorothy passed by Daisy on the straight"" - This indicates that Dorothy was initially in the lead.
2. ""but she re-took the lead"" - This implies that the subject ""she"" had lost the lead at some point.
3. ""by barging through the inside of the hairpin"" - This describes the action of regaining the lead.

Given this information, we can deduce that ""she"" refers to Daisy. Here's why:

- Dorothy was initially in the lead (she ""passed by Daisy"").
- The pronoun ""she"" is described as ""re-taking"" the lead, which means this person had lost the lead earlier.
- The only person who could have lost the lead and then regained it is Daisy, as Dorothy was already ahead.

Therefore, ""she"" in this context refers to Daisy, who lost the lead when Dorothy passed her, but then regained it at the hairpin turn.",1,1
1591,"Katie nearly leaves Bernadette after believing that she had possibly slept with Brooke, though this was not the case.",she,"0: Katie, 1: Bernadette, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. Katie is the subject of the sentence, performing the action of ""nearly leaving"".
2. Bernadette is the object of Katie's action.
3. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""she had possibly slept with Brooke"".

Given this context, it's more likely that ""she"" refers to Bernadette rather than Katie. The sentence structure suggests that Katie nearly leaves Bernadette because of something Bernadette (allegedly) did, not something Katie did. It wouldn't make sense for Katie to nearly leave Bernadette because Katie herself had slept with Brooke.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Bernadette.",1,1
1592,"Lola comforted Bianca after she revealed to her that she was gay, and she used her unique brand of humor to help make her feel better about herself.",she,"0: Lola, 1: Bianca, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which 'she' refers to Lola or Bianca. Let's break it down:

1. 'Lola comforted Bianca' - This establishes Lola as the comforter and Bianca as the one being comforted.
2. 'after she revealed to her that she was gay' - This 'she' likely refers to Bianca, as she is revealing something personal about herself to Lola.
3. 'and she used her unique brand of humor' - This 'she' most likely refers back to Lola, as she is the one comforting and using humor to help.
4. 'to help make her feel better about herself' - This 'her' refers to Bianca, who is being made to feel better.

Given that the pronoun we're asked about is the first 'she' in the sentence, which reveals being gay, it most likely refers to Bianca.",1,1
1593,"Julie attempts to get to know Molly, but she remains distant.",she,"0: Julie, 1: Molly, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. The context suggests that Julie is trying to get to know Molly, but someone ""remains distant."" Given the structure of the sentence, it's more likely that ""she"" refers to Molly for the following reasons:

1. Julie is the active subject who is attempting to get to know Molly.
2. The conjunction ""but"" introduces a contrast to Julie's action.
3. The phrase ""remains distant"" describes a passive or resistant behavior, which contrasts with Julie's active attempt to get to know someone.

Therefore, it makes more sense that Molly is the one who ""remains distant"" in response to Julie's attempts to get to know her.",1,1
1594,"Jose helps Riley heal after he receives a letter from Flash, breaking up with him.",he,"0: Jose, 1: Riley, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions two male names: Jose and Riley.
2. The pronoun ""he"" appears twice in the sentence.
3. The first ""he"" is the subject of ""receives a letter.""
4. The second ""him"" is the object of ""breaking up with.""

Given the sentence structure, it's more likely that Riley is the one receiving the letter and being broken up with. This is because:

1. Jose is mentioned as helping Riley heal, implying Riley is the one who needs healing.
2. The breakup is causing the need for healing, so Riley is likely the one being broken up with.

Therefore, both instances of ""he"" in the sentence most likely refer to Riley.",1,1
1595,Helen is waiting for Lorelei when her plane lands in New York.,her,"0: Lorelei, 1: Helen, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""her"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. Helen is waiting for Lorelei.
2. The plane is landing in New York.
3. The pronoun ""her"" is used in relation to the plane.

Given this information, it's more logical that ""her"" refers to Lorelei for the following reasons:
- Helen is waiting, which implies she's already in New York.
- The plane that's landing is more likely to be associated with the person who is arriving, not the person who is waiting.
- It's common to say ""her plane"" when referring to the plane someone is traveling on.

Therefore, ""her"" most likely refers to Lorelei (candidate 0).",0,0
1596,Karl was cleaning after Joey when he found his gun.,he,"0: Karl, 1: Joey, 2: Neither","To determine who ""he"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and the most logical interpretation:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" is performing an action (finding) that occurs after the main clause (""Karl was cleaning after Joey"").

2. It's more likely that the person doing the cleaning (Karl) would be the one to find something during the process of cleaning.

3. The pronoun ""he"" is closer to ""Karl"" in the sentence, which often indicates that it refers to the nearest preceding noun.

4. The possessive pronoun ""his"" in ""his gun"" likely refers to Joey, as it would be redundant to say ""Karl found Karl's gun"" and more natural to specify if Karl found his own gun.

Given these points, it's most logical to conclude that ""he"" refers to Karl.",1,0
1597,Tai tries to help Agumon using distraction but he fails.,he,"0: Tai, 1: Agumon, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Tai is the subject of the sentence and is performing an action (trying to help).
2. Agumon is the object of Tai's action (being helped).
3. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""but he fails.""

Given this structure, it's more likely that ""he"" refers to Tai for the following reasons:
- Tai is the main actor in the sentence.
- The failure mentioned is related to the action of helping, which Tai was attempting.
- It's more natural to continue referring to the subject (Tai) rather than switching to the object (Agumon) without a clear indication.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Tai.",1,0
1598,"Caroline was suspicious of what Madeline was doing, but no one believed her and she was fired from the clinic.",her,"0: Caroline, 1: Madeline, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""her"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence mentions two people: Caroline and Madeline.
2. The pronoun ""her"" is used in the phrase ""no one believed her.""
3. The sentence structure suggests that Caroline was suspicious of Madeline's actions.
4. The consequence of not being believed is that ""she was fired from the clinic.""

Given this information, it's logical to conclude that ""her"" refers to Caroline because:
a) Caroline is the subject of the main clause and the one who was suspicious.
b) The sentence implies that Caroline's suspicions were not believed by others.
c) The consequence of being fired is more likely to happen to the person whose concerns were not believed (Caroline) rather than the person being suspected (Madeline).

Therefore, the pronoun ""her"" most likely refers to Caroline.",0,0
1599,Rachel broke up with Ada when she realised that the relationship was n't going anywhere.,she,"0: Rachel, 1: Ada, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Rachel broke up with Ada"".
2. This is followed by ""when she realised"".
3. The pronoun ""she"" is more likely to refer to the subject of the main clause (Rachel) rather than the object (Ada).
4. It's more logical that the person initiating the breakup (Rachel) would be the one realizing that the relationship wasn't going anywhere.

Based on these points, it's most probable that ""she"" refers to Rachel, who is the subject of the sentence and the one taking the action of breaking up.",0,0
1600,Matt turned against Tony when he turned scab and crossed the picket lines to work.,he,"0: Matt, 1: Tony, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Matt turned against Tony...""
2. This is followed by ""when he turned scab...""

The pronoun ""he"" is more likely to refer to Tony for the following reasons:
1. Tony is the most recently mentioned person before the pronoun ""he"" appears, making it the more natural antecedent.
2. The action of ""turning scab"" (breaking a strike by continuing to work) is presented as the reason for Matt turning against Tony. It makes more sense that Matt would turn against Tony for Tony's actions, rather than for Matt's own actions.
3. The phrase ""turned against"" implies a change in Matt's attitude towards Tony, which is then explained by the action that follows (turning scab).

Therefore, based on the context and sentence structure, ""he"" most likely refers to Tony.",1,1
1601,"Chris was desperate to convince Richard to stay, so he got Victor to offer him a promotion.",he,"0: Chris, 1: Richard, 2: Neither","To determine who the pronoun ""he"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and the logical flow of the sentence.

1. The sentence starts with ""Chris was desperate to convince Richard to stay"".
2. Then it says ""so he got Victor to offer him a promotion"".

The pronoun ""he"" is used as the subject of the action ""got Victor to offer him a promotion"". This action is a continuation of Chris's efforts to convince Richard to stay. It makes logical sense that Chris would be the one arranging for a promotion to be offered to Richard, as Chris is the one trying to convince Richard to stay.

Therefore, ""he"" most likely refers to Chris, not Richard. Richard is the one being offered the promotion (referred to as ""him"" in the latter part of the sentence), while Chris is the one arranging for the promotion to be offered.",0,0
1602,Michael had always felt that Dominic had been deprived and so he left him the money in his will as a form of compensation.,him,"0: Michael, 1: Dominic, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""him"" refers to, let's analyze the sentence:

1. The sentence is about Michael's actions and thoughts towards Dominic.
2. Michael is the subject of the main clause, performing the action of leaving money.
3. Dominic is mentioned as the person Michael felt had been deprived.
4. The pronoun ""him"" is used in the context of receiving money from Michael's will.

Given this information, it's clear that ""him"" refers to Dominic, not Michael. Michael is the one leaving the money, while Dominic is the recipient. The pronoun ""him"" is used to avoid repeating Dominic's name in the same sentence.",1,1
1603,"Christina fell in love with Lucy, but she no longer had any feelings for her and she took off to Australia.",she,"0: Christina, 1: Lucy, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. ""Christina fell in love with Lucy"" - This establishes the two characters.
2. ""but she no longer had any feelings for her"" - This ""she"" likely refers to Christina, as she's the subject of the first clause. ""Her"" refers to Lucy.
3. ""and she took off to Australia"" - This ""she"" is most likely referring to the same person as the previous ""she"", which we determined was probably Christina.

The pronoun ""she"" appears twice in this sentence, and in both cases, it seems to be referring to Christina. Christina is the one who no longer had feelings and who took off to Australia. Lucy is only mentioned as the object of Christina's former affection.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" in this context refers to Christina.",0,0
1604,"Mark runs out of the store to find Karl, but an iron beam falls from above and kill him.",him,"0: Mark, 1: Karl, 2: Neither","To determine who the pronoun ""him"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence starts with ""Mark runs out of the store to find Karl.""
2. Then it mentions ""an iron beam falls from above.""
3. Finally, it states that the beam ""kill him.""

Given this information, we can deduce:

- Mark is the active subject of the sentence, running out of the store.
- Karl is the person Mark is trying to find, but Karl's location and actions are not specified.
- The iron beam falls and kills someone.

Since Mark is the one actively moving in the scene, he is more likely to be in the path of the falling beam. The pronoun ""him"" is more likely to refer to Mark in this context. Karl's position and involvement in the scene are not clear, making him less likely to be the victim of the falling beam.

Therefore, the pronoun ""him"" most likely refers to Mark.",1,0
1605,"Lance tried to get back together with Bob, but his pride was hurt and he refused to take her back.",his,"0: Lance, 1: Bob, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. Lance tried to get back together with Bob.
2. ""His pride was hurt"" - this refers to someone's pride being hurt.
3. ""He refused to take her back"" - this indicates that the person whose pride was hurt is male (he) and is refusing to take back a female (her).

Given this information, we can deduce:
- Lance is trying to get back together, so Lance is likely female (referred to as ""her"" later).
- Bob is refusing to take ""her"" back, so Bob is likely male.
- ""His pride was hurt"" refers to Bob, as he's the one refusing to take Lance back.

Therefore, ""his"" in this context refers to Bob.",1,1
1606,"Marcy would continue to have that crush on Brenda, until Lisa finally set her straight.",her,"0: Marcy, 1: Brenda, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""her"" most likely refers to Marcy for the following reasons:

1. The sentence is primarily about Marcy's crush on Brenda.
2. The phrase ""set her straight"" implies that someone (Lisa) is correcting or informing the person with the crush.
3. It makes more sense in context for Lisa to be setting Marcy straight about her crush on Brenda, rather than setting Brenda straight.
4. Marcy is the subject of the sentence and the main focus of the action, making her the most likely antecedent for the pronoun ""her.""

Therefore, the pronoun ""her"" in this context most likely refers to Marcy.",0,0
1607,"Suddenly, the Virgin Mary appears to Alexa when her army is on the brink of complete defeat.",her,"0: the Virgin Mary, 1: Alexa, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine whether the pronoun ""her"" refers to the Virgin Mary, Alexa, or neither. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence mentions two female entities: the Virgin Mary and Alexa.
2. The pronoun ""her"" is used in the phrase ""her army.""
3. It's more likely that Alexa, being a human character, would have an army rather than the Virgin Mary, who is typically depicted as a religious figure.
4. The sentence structure suggests that the Virgin Mary is appearing to Alexa, implying that Alexa is the main subject of the action.

Based on these observations, it's most logical to conclude that ""her"" refers to Alexa. The army being mentioned is likely Alexa's army, which is facing defeat when the Virgin Mary appears to her.",1,1
1608,"Mrs. Miranda uses this information to force Janice into surrendering, since she wo n't be able to shoot all three hostages.",she,"0: Janice, 1: Mrs. Miranda, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" refers to Janice, not Mrs. Miranda. The context suggests that Mrs. Miranda is using information to force Janice into surrendering, implying that Janice is the one who ""won't be able to shoot all three hostages."" This interpretation makes sense because:

1. Mrs. Miranda is described as using information to force Janice into surrendering, which puts Janice in the position of the person being pressured.
2. The clause ""since she won't be able to shoot all three hostages"" is explaining why Janice is being forced to surrender, indicating that Janice is the one who might have considered shooting the hostages.
3. It would not make sense for Mrs. Miranda to be unable to shoot the hostages in this context, as she is the one applying pressure to Janice.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Janice (candidate 0).",0,0
1609,"Mack proposes to Arnold, but he gently turns him down and moves in with Harriet.",he,"0: Mack, 1: Arnold, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Mack proposes to Arnold
2. ""he"" gently turns ""him"" down
3. ""he"" moves in with Harriet

Based on this information, we can deduce that ""he"" refers to Arnold because:
- Arnold is the one being proposed to, so he would be the one to accept or reject the proposal.
- The pronoun ""him"" in ""turns him down"" likely refers to Mack, as he was the one proposing.
- It makes more sense that Arnold, after rejecting the proposal, would move in with Harriet rather than Mack moving in with Harriet after being rejected.

Therefore, ""he"" in this context refers to Arnold.",1,1
1610,"Heisenberg becomes suspicious of Mike after he finds a photograph of Lori Shannon, Mike's former girlfriend.",he,"0: Heisenberg, 1: Mike, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Heisenberg. The sentence structure indicates that Heisenberg is the subject who becomes suspicious and finds the photograph. The pronoun ""he"" is used to avoid repeating Heisenberg's name in the same sentence. It's clear that Heisenberg is the one performing the action of finding the photograph, which leads to his suspicion of Mike.",0,0
1611,Tom stood by Gilly and was relieved when he was found innocent.,he,"0: Tom, 1: Gilly, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, let's analyze the sentence:

1. The sentence mentions two people: Tom and Gilly.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used later in the sentence.
3. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" refers to the subject of the sentence, which is Tom.
4. The context implies that Tom was relieved when someone (referred to as ""he"") was found innocent.
5. It makes more sense logically that Tom would be relieved about his own innocence rather than Gilly's.

Based on these observations, it is most likely that ""he"" refers to Tom.",0,0
1612,"Darren pulls Nancy away but then she grabs at her, ripping her dress exposing her fake pregnancy to the crowd.",she,"0: Darren, 1: Nancy, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" is used multiple times, but we need to determine which instance we're focusing on. Given the context, it appears that ""she"" refers to Nancy. The sentence describes a sequence of actions where Darren pulls Nancy away, and then ""she"" (Nancy) grabs at ""her"" (likely referring to Darren or another female character). The subsequent actions (ripping her dress, exposing her fake pregnancy) are more likely to be performed by Nancy than Darren. Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" in this context most likely refers to Nancy.",1,1
1613,"Tony slowly gets fed up with James, especially after his beautiful daughter arrives.",his,"0: Tony, 1: James, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""his"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence mentions Tony and James.
2. The pronoun ""his"" is used in relation to a ""beautiful daughter.""
3. The sentence structure suggests that ""his"" refers to one of the two mentioned individuals.

Given the context, it's more likely that ""his"" refers to James rather than Tony for the following reasons:

1. The sentence describes Tony getting fed up with James, which sets up James as the focus of the latter part of the sentence.
2. The phrase ""especially after his beautiful daughter arrives"" is presented as an additional reason for Tony's frustration with James.
3. It's more natural to interpret this as James' daughter arriving, which further aggravates Tony, rather than Tony's own daughter being a reason for his frustration with James.

Therefore, the pronoun ""his"" most likely refers to James.",1,1
1614,"Krishna agreed and let Rukmi go free, but not before having his head shaved as a visible sign of a warrior's defeat.",his,"0: Krishna, 1: Rukmi, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""his"" refers to Rukmi. The context indicates that Krishna is the one performing the action of letting Rukmi go free and shaving someone's head. Since Krishna is the subject performing these actions, it's logical that the person whose head is being shaved is Rukmi. The shaving of the head is described as ""a visible sign of a warrior's defeat,"" which further supports that it is Rukmi, the defeated warrior, whose head is being shaved. Therefore, ""his"" in this context refers to Rukmi.",0,1
1615,"Callina asks Beltran if he has sworn allegiance to the Compact, the most sacred of Comyn laws.",he,"0: Callina, 1: Beltran, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" clearly refers to Beltran. The context indicates that Callina is asking Beltran a question about his allegiance to the Compact. The pronoun ""he"" is used to refer to the person being asked, which is Beltran. Callina, being the one asking the question, is referred to by name and is female (as indicated by the name), so ""he"" cannot refer to her. Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" must refer to Beltran.",1,1
1616,"Elmeida nearly assassinated Hyrum, but Noa intervened to save his life.",his,"0: Elmeida, 1: Hyrum, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. ""Elmeida nearly assassinated Hyrum"" - This establishes that Elmeida (likely female) was attempting to kill Hyrum (likely male).

2. ""but Noa intervened to save his life"" - The pronoun ""his"" is used here, and we need to determine who it refers to.

3. Given the context, ""his life"" is referring to the person whose life was being saved by Noa's intervention.

4. Since Elmeida was trying to assassinate Hyrum, it's Hyrum's life that was in danger and needed saving.

5. Therefore, ""his"" most likely refers to Hyrum.

The pronoun ""his"" cannot refer to Elmeida (who is likely female) or Noa (who is not mentioned as being in danger). It clearly refers to Hyrum, whose life was being saved.",1,1
1617,Laura tries to save Mona but she deliberately swims into the path of a group of sharks and is eaten alive.,she,"0: Laura, 1: Mona, 2: Neither","To determine who ""she"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and the actions described:

1. Laura is trying to save Mona.
2. ""She"" deliberately swims into the path of sharks.
3. ""She"" is eaten alive.

Given this information, it's clear that the person being saved (Mona) is the one who deliberately swims into danger. It wouldn't make sense for Laura to be trying to save Mona and then deliberately put herself in danger. Therefore, ""she"" in this context refers to Mona.",1,1
1618,"Melinda is disappointed Anna does not turn up, but suddenly realizes she is not aware of this event.",she,"0: Anna, 1: Melinda, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence mentions two people: Melinda and Anna.
2. Melinda is disappointed that Anna does not turn up.
3. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the phrase ""she is not aware of this event.""

Given this information, we can deduce that ""she"" most likely refers to Anna for the following reasons:
- Melinda is already aware of the event, as she is disappointed by Anna's absence.
- The sudden realization that ""she is not aware of this event"" implies that this is new information about Anna.
- It would be illogical for Melinda to suddenly realize she herself is not aware of the event she's disappointed about.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Anna (candidate 0).",1,0
1619,Ava dares not let Aime find out where she works.,she,"0: Ava, 1: Aime, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Ava. The sentence structure suggests that Ava is the subject who is trying to keep information from Aime. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the context of describing the person who doesn't want their workplace known, which aligns with Ava's action of not wanting Aime to find out. It wouldn't make sense for ""she"" to refer to Aime in this context, as Aime is the one being kept in the dark about the information.",0,0
1620,"In the original Novel, Greco is killed by Larmica, but in the manga he is fatally wounded by Rei Ginsei.",he,"0: Greco, 1: Larmica, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" clearly refers to Greco. The sentence is comparing two different versions of events: one from the original novel and one from the manga. In both cases, Greco is the subject who is being killed or fatally wounded. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the second part of the sentence to refer back to Greco, avoiding repetition of his name. Larmica is mentioned as the one who kills Greco in the novel, but is not the subject of the pronoun ""he"" in this context.",0,0
1621,Beverly thinks that Olivia walked because she saw her wearing the bracelet.,she,"0: Beverly, 1: Olivia, 2: Neither","To determine who ""she"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and logical flow:

1. The main clause is ""Beverly thinks that Olivia walked.""
2. The subordinate clause ""because she saw her wearing the bracelet"" provides the reason for Beverly's thought.

The pronoun ""she"" is more likely to refer to Beverly because:

1. Beverly is the subject of the main clause and the one doing the thinking.
2. The action of seeing someone wearing a bracelet is more likely to be the reason for Beverly's thought about Olivia walking, rather than Olivia's own observation.
3. If ""she"" referred to Olivia, the sentence would imply that Olivia saw herself wearing the bracelet, which is less logical in this context.

Therefore, it makes more sense for ""she"" to refer to Beverly, who saw Olivia wearing the bracelet and concluded that Olivia had walked.",1,0
1622,"Eclipso then attempts to kill Mehdi, but finds that he is too strong.",he,"0: Eclipso, 1: Mehdi, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Mehdi. The context suggests that Eclipso is attempting to kill Mehdi, but finds that Mehdi is too strong to be killed. The pronoun ""he"" is used to describe the person who is ""too strong,"" which logically refers to Mehdi, not Eclipso. Eclipso is the subject performing the action (attempting to kill), while Mehdi is the object being acted upon and is described as strong.",1,1
1623,"Ichikawa had heard that Curtis was very thin, so he decided to use him, as the characters in the story have eaten very little.",he,"0: Ichikawa, 1: Curtis, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Ichikawa. The sentence structure indicates that Ichikawa is the subject who had heard about Curtis and made a decision based on that information. The pronoun ""he"" is used to continue referring to Ichikawa as the subject of the action ""decided to use him."" The ""him"" in this case refers to Curtis, but the pronoun we're asked about (""he"") clearly refers to Ichikawa.",1,0
1624,"Marc then tells David that if he helps him, he will tell him important information that will help save Daniels job.",he,"0: Marc, 1: David, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. ""Marc then tells David that..."" - This establishes Marc as the subject and David as the object of the first part of the sentence.

2. ""...if he helps him..."" - This is where the first ""he"" appears. In this context, ""he"" is likely referring to David, because it's more logical for Marc to be asking David for help, rather than offering to help David. The ""him"" in this part would then refer to Marc.

3. ""...he will tell him important information..."" - The second ""he"" is likely referring back to Marc, as he would be the one to provide information in exchange for help. The ""him"" here would refer to David, who would receive the information.

4. ""...that will help save Daniel's job."" - This is additional information about what Marc will tell David.

Given this analysis, the pronoun ""he"" in the question most likely refers to David (candidate 1), as he is the one being asked to help.",1,1
1625,"Robert Redford was the first choice for the role of Guy Woodhouse, but he turned down the offer.",he,"0: Robert Redford, 1: Guy Woodhouse, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" clearly refers to Robert Redford. The sentence states that Robert Redford was offered the role of Guy Woodhouse but turned it down. The pronoun ""he"" is used to avoid repeating Robert Redford's name when describing his action of turning down the offer. Guy Woodhouse is mentioned only as the character Robert Redford was offered to play, not as the subject performing any action. Therefore, ""he"" must refer to Robert Redford.",0,0
1626,Harry is angry with Ron at first but then he reconciles with him.,him,"0: Harry, 1: Ron, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""him"" refers to. Let's break it down:

1. ""Harry is angry with Ron at first"" - This establishes that Harry is the subject and Ron is the object of Harry's anger.
2. ""but then he reconciles with him"" - Here, ""he"" likely refers to Harry (the subject of the first clause), and ""him"" refers to the person Harry is reconciling with.

Since Harry was angry with Ron, and then a reconciliation happens, it makes sense that Harry is reconciling with Ron. Therefore, ""him"" in this context refers to Ron.",1,1
1627,"Jackie Rice was also considered to play Kristal, but she was suspended by the network for attitude problems.",she,"0: Kristal, 1: Jackie Rice, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions two people: Jackie Rice and Kristal.
2. The pronoun ""she"" appears in the second part of the sentence, after the comma.
3. The information following ""she"" states that ""she was suspended by the network for attitude problems.""

Given this information, it's more likely that ""she"" refers to Jackie Rice rather than Kristal for the following reasons:
1. Jackie Rice is the main subject of the sentence.
2. The suspension due to attitude problems is presented as additional information about Jackie Rice, explaining why she was only ""considered"" for the role of Kristal.
3. If ""she"" referred to Kristal, it would be an abrupt and confusing shift in the subject of the sentence.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Jackie Rice.",0,1
1628,Jack Osborne threw Gilly Roach out after his behaviour became increasingly aggressive following Steph Cunningham's death.,his,"0: Jack Osborne, 1: Gilly Roach, 2: Neither","The pronoun ""his"" in this sentence refers to Gilly Roach's behavior, not Jack Osborne's. The sentence structure indicates that Jack Osborne is the one who threw Gilly Roach out, and the reason for this action was Gilly's aggressive behavior. The phrase ""his behaviour became increasingly aggressive"" is describing Gilly Roach, as it explains why he was thrown out by Jack Osborne. Therefore, the pronoun ""his"" refers to Gilly Roach.",0,1
1629,"Gluhak was naturally taller than Topi, but her hairstyle and high-heeled boots resulted in a considerable height discrepancy.",her,"0: Gluhak, 1: Topi, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""her"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Gluhak is mentioned first and is described as ""naturally taller than Topi.""
2. The pronoun ""her"" is used in reference to someone's hairstyle and high-heeled boots.
3. These features (hairstyle and boots) are said to result in ""a considerable height discrepancy.""

Given that Gluhak is already described as naturally taller, it wouldn't make sense for her to need additional height from hairstyle and boots to create a discrepancy. Therefore, ""her"" most likely refers to Topi, who is the shorter of the two and would need these elements to create a height discrepancy with the naturally taller Gluhak.",1,1
1630,"Seeing armed cadet, the driver tried to escape, but he and his companions were caught and brought to the military academy.",he,"0: armed cadet, 1: the driver, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to ""the driver"" for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""the driver"" is the main subject of the action after the comma.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in conjunction with ""his companions,"" implying that ""he"" is part of a group that was caught. This group is more likely to be associated with the driver than the armed cadet.
3. The armed cadet is mentioned as an observation that prompted the driver's action, not as the main subject of the subsequent events.
4. It's more logical in the context that the driver and his companions were trying to escape and were then caught, rather than the armed cadet trying to escape.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to ""the driver"" (candidate 1).",1,1
1631,Mr. Hillyer attributes this to Richard but he repeatedly denies knowing them.,he,"0: Richard, 1: Mr. Hillyer, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Richard. The reasoning is as follows:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" is the subject of the second clause, which is contrasting with the first clause.
2. Mr. Hillyer is attributing something to Richard in the first part of the sentence.
3. The second part of the sentence uses ""but"" to introduce a contrasting action, which is denial.
4. It would make more sense for Richard to be denying knowledge of something attributed to him, rather than Mr. Hillyer denying knowledge of his own attribution.

Therefore, ""he"" in this context most likely refers to Richard (candidate 0).",0,0
1632,"Again, Helene tries to force Mary, but she rejects her very violently.",she,"0: Helene, 1: Mary, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Helene is trying to force Mary to do something.
2. ""She"" rejects ""her"" very violently.

Given this information, it's clear that ""she"" refers to Mary, because:
1. Mary is the one being forced by Helene, so she would be the one to reject.
2. The pronoun ""her"" in ""rejects her"" likely refers to Helene, further indicating that ""she"" is Mary.

Therefore, ""she"" in this context refers to Mary, who is rejecting Helene's attempt to force her.",1,1
1633,"The Avengers massacres the mobsters, but sustain injuries during the battle that leave them temporarily incapacitated.",them,"0: The Avengers, 1: the mobsters, 2: Neither","The pronoun 'them' in this sentence refers to 'The Avengers' for the following reasons:
1. The sentence structure indicates that 'The Avengers' is the subject performing the action (massacring the mobsters).
2. The pronoun 'them' is used in the latter part of the sentence to describe a group that sustains injuries and becomes incapacitated.
3. It's more logical that the group sustaining injuries would be The Avengers, as they were actively engaged in battle, rather than the mobsters who were being massacred.
4. The use of 'but' suggests a contrast between the Avengers' success in defeating the mobsters and the consequences they faced (injuries and incapacitation).",0,0
1634,"Pedro frequently sings to Pablo, and he believes he is beautiful because of his voice.",he,"0: Pedro, 1: Pablo, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""he"" the pronoun refers to. There are two instances of ""he"" in the sentence, and we need to analyze them separately:

1. First ""he"": ""he believes""
   This ""he"" is more likely to refer to Pedro because Pedro is the subject of the main clause (""Pedro frequently sings to Pablo""). It's natural for the subject to continue being the focus in the following clause.

2. Second ""he"": ""he is beautiful""
   This ""he"" is ambiguous and could refer to either Pedro or Pablo. It depends on who is believed to be beautiful.

3. ""his voice""
   This ""his"" likely refers to Pedro, as Pedro is the one singing, and it would make more sense for Pedro to believe he is beautiful because of his own voice rather than Pablo's voice.

Given this analysis, the pronoun ""he"" in this sentence most likely refers to Pedro (candidate 0) in both instances. While there is some ambiguity, the overall context suggests Pedro as the primary subject of the sentence.",1,
1635,Colman had planned to kill Dexter but decides that he wants him arrested instead.,he,"0: Colman, 1: Dexter, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who the pronoun ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Colman had planned to kill Dexter.""
2. Then it continues with ""but decides that he wants him arrested instead.""

The pronoun ""he"" in this context refers to the subject of the decision-making, which is Colman. Colman is the one who had initially planned to kill Dexter but then changes his mind and decides on a different course of action (wanting Dexter arrested).

The pronoun ""him"" later in the sentence refers to Dexter, as he is the object of the planned action (first killing, then arresting).

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" in this sentence refers to Colman.",0,0
1636,Cecile eventually begins to fall deeply for Mia and so does she.,she,"0: Cecile, 1: Mia, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. The sentence structure suggests that ""she"" is referring to someone other than Cecile, as it states ""Cecile eventually begins to fall deeply for Mia and so does she."" This implies that there are two people falling for Mia: Cecile and someone else.

Given the context and the candidates provided, the most logical interpretation is that ""she"" refers to Mia. This creates a reciprocal situation where Cecile is falling for Mia, and Mia is also falling for Cecile (or possibly herself, though this is less likely).

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Mia in this context.",1,1
1637,"Wiriya does not like Nanthagorna because she knows that she likes her best friend, Majsha.",she,"0: Wiriya, 1: Nanthagorna, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which 'she' refers to. Let's break it down:

1. The first 'she' in 'she knows' is likely referring to Wiriya, as Wiriya is the subject of the main clause and is the one who doesn't like Nanthagorna.

2. The second 'she' in 'she likes' is ambiguous and could refer to either Wiriya or Nanthagorna. However, given the context, it's more likely to refer to Nanthagorna, as this would explain why Wiriya doesn't like her.

3. The pronoun we're specifically asked about is just 'she', without any additional context. In this case, we should consider the first occurrence of 'she' in the sentence, which refers to Wiriya.

Therefore, the pronoun 'she' most likely refers to Wiriya.",0,0
1638,Scott is charged with raping Brian but he was sensationally acquitted at trial.,he,"0: Scott, 1: Brian, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Scott for the following reasons:

1. Scott is the subject of the main clause and is mentioned first, making him the more prominent character in the sentence.
2. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" is the subject of the passive verb ""was acquitted,"" which logically follows that Scott (the accused) would be the one acquitted at trial.
3. It would be unusual for Brian (the alleged victim) to be acquitted in this context, as he is not the one on trial.

Therefore, based on the context and sentence structure, ""he"" most likely refers to Scott.",0,0
1639,Elliot tries to stand up for Paul when he is taunted by Wayne Tunnicliffe and Sonny Valentine.,he,"0: Elliot, 1: Paul, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Paul for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure suggests that Elliot is performing an action (trying to stand up for someone), while Paul is the recipient of an action (being taunted).

2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""when he is taunted,"" which directly follows the mention of Paul. This proximity indicates that ""he"" is referring to Paul.

3. It would be grammatically awkward and unclear if ""he"" referred to Elliot in this context, as it would mean Elliot is standing up for Paul when Elliot himself is being taunted, which doesn't align with the overall meaning of the sentence.

4. The sentence is describing a scenario where one person (Elliot) is defending another (Paul) from bullying or taunting, which further supports that ""he"" refers to Paul, the one being taunted.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Paul in this context.",1,"1

1640,"Janine responds by throwing Teresa out, though she later lets an insistent Teresa stay a little longer, much to Mel's dismay.",she,"0: Janine, 1: Teresa, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. The first part of the sentence states ""Janine responds by throwing Teresa out"".
2. The second part starts with ""though she later lets an insistent Teresa stay a little longer"".

The pronoun ""she"" in the second part must refer to the person who is doing the action of letting Teresa stay. Since Janine was the one who initially threw Teresa out, it logically follows that Janine is also the one who later allows Teresa to stay.

Therefore, ""she"" in this context refers to Janine.",0,0
1641,"Bourret was supported by Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine because as a moderate, he was acceptable to the rich Anglo-Saxons who formed the majority of the Montreal electorate.",he,"0: Bourret, 1: Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Bourret for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure indicates that Bourret is the main subject being discussed.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used to provide additional information about Bourret, describing him as a moderate.
3. The phrase ""as a moderate, he was acceptable"" logically connects to Bourret being supported by Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine.
4. It wouldn't make sense for ""he"" to refer to Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine, as Lafontaine is mentioned as the one providing support, not the one being described as moderate or acceptable to the Anglo-Saxons.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Bourret.",0,0
1642,"For weeks, Dusty blamed Lucy for Jen's death, because she was Jen's doctor.",she,"0: Lucy, 1: Dusty, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who the pronoun ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence mentions three people: Dusty, Lucy, and Jen.
2. Dusty is blaming Lucy for Jen's death.
3. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""because she was Jen's doctor.""

Given this information, we can deduce that ""she"" refers to Lucy for the following reasons:
- The sentence states that Dusty blamed Lucy, which implies that Lucy had some responsibility in Jen's death.
- The explanation for the blame is that ""she was Jen's doctor.""
- It makes logical sense that Lucy, as Jen's doctor, would be the one blamed for Jen's death, rather than Dusty (who is doing the blaming) or Jen herself (who has died).

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Lucy.",1,0
1643,"Zwingli was also aware of and influenced by the Wittenberg reformer Martin Luther, but he developed his theology independently and differed with him in several ways.",he,"0: Zwingli, 1: the Wittenberg reformer Martin Luther, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Zwingli for the following reasons:

1. Zwingli is the subject of the main clause and the first person mentioned in the sentence, making him the most likely antecedent for subsequent pronouns.

2. The sentence structure indicates that Zwingli is the one who was ""aware of and influenced by"" Luther, and then continues to describe Zwingli's actions (developing his theology independently and differing with Luther).

3. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the context of developing theology and differing with Luther, which logically follows the initial statement about Zwingli being aware of and influenced by Luther.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Zwingli (candidate 0) rather than Martin Luther or neither.",1,0
1644,"Gareth is sympathetic to Jeff, but still does not feel he can return his love.",he,"0: Gareth, 1: Jeff, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Gareth is the subject of the main clause.
2. Jeff is mentioned as the object of Gareth's sympathy.
3. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the second part of the sentence, stating that ""he"" cannot return ""his"" love.

Given this information, it's most logical that ""he"" refers to Gareth for the following reasons:
- Gareth is the main subject of the sentence, making him the most likely antecedent for subsequent pronouns.
- The sentence structure suggests that Gareth is the one who ""cannot return his love,"" where ""his"" would refer to Jeff's love.
- It wouldn't make sense for Jeff to be unable to return his own love, so ""he"" is more likely to refer to Gareth.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Gareth.",0,0
1645,"Kushal convinces Prabhu to stay back overnight, so that he can meet Padma the next day.",he,"0: Kushal, 1: Prabhu, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun 'he' most likely refers to Prabhu, not Kushal. The context suggests that Kushal is convincing Prabhu to stay overnight for a specific purpose - so that 'he' (Prabhu) can meet Padma the next day. It makes more sense that Prabhu is the one being convinced to stay and meet someone, rather than Kushal convincing Prabhu to stay so that Kushal himself can meet Padma.",1,1
1646,"As Tao waits for Ling Shih-hua to recover so he can beat him, he runs into an old man who teaches him the art of t ` ai chi.",he,"0: Tao, 1: Ling Shih-hua, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. The first ""he"" in ""so he can beat him"" clearly refers to Tao, as Tao is waiting for Ling Shih-hua to recover in order to beat Ling Shih-hua.

2. The second ""he"" in ""he runs into an old man"" is the pronoun we're asked to identify.

Given the structure of the sentence, it's most logical that this ""he"" also refers to Tao. The sentence is describing Tao's actions: first waiting, then running into an old man. It wouldn't make sense for this ""he"" to suddenly refer to Ling Shih-hua, who is only mentioned as the object of Tao's waiting and intended beating.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" in question refers to Tao.",1,0
1647,Naungdawgyi forgave Hsinbyushin possibly because he was more concerned with a possible insurrection by the army.,he,"0: Naungdawgyi, 1: Hsinbyushin, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun 'he' most likely refers to Naungdawgyi. The sentence structure suggests that Naungdawgyi is the subject who performed the action of forgiving Hsinbyushin. The clause 'because he was more concerned' provides a reason for Naungdawgyi's action of forgiving. It makes more sense contextually that Naungdawgyi, as the one doing the forgiving, would be the one concerned about a possible insurrection, rather than Hsinbyushin, who was being forgiven.",1,0
1648,"Andre feels sympathetic for Jeff, but still does n't feel he can return his love.",he,"0: Andre, 1: Jeff, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Andre is the subject of the sentence and is feeling sympathetic towards Jeff.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""he can return his love.""
3. The phrase ""return his love"" implies that Jeff is the one who has expressed love for Andre.
4. Andre is the one who can't return the love, as he is feeling sympathetic but not reciprocating the romantic feelings.

Given this analysis, ""he"" most likely refers to Andre, as he is the one who can't return Jeff's love.",0,0
1649,Matthew is later murdered by Jean when he inflicted an instantaneous stroke upon him.,he,"0: Matthew, 1: Jean, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""he"" refers to. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""when he inflicted an instantaneous stroke upon him."" Let's analyze the context:

1. Matthew is the subject of the first part of the sentence, being the one who is murdered.
2. Jean is mentioned as the one who murders Matthew.
3. The pronoun ""he"" is used to describe the person inflicting the stroke.
4. The pronoun ""him"" at the end of the sentence likely refers to Matthew, as he is the one being murdered.

Given this information, it's clear that ""he"" refers to Jean, as Jean is the one performing the action of inflicting the stroke upon Matthew. Matthew is the recipient of the action, referred to as ""him"" at the end of the sentence.",1,1
1650,"William Miller found that the more confrontational a counselor was, the more his or her clients with alcohol problems drank.",his,"0: a counselor, 1: William Miller, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""his"" is used in the phrase ""his or her clients"". This pronoun is referring to the counselor mentioned earlier in the sentence. The sentence is discussing the findings of William Miller about counselors and their clients. William Miller is the researcher who made the observation, not the counselor being referred to. Therefore, ""his"" refers to ""a counselor"" rather than William Miller.",0,0
1651,Jon is still trying to kick Paul out but he wants his help.,he,"0: Jon, 1: Paul, 2: Neither","To determine who ""he"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and the logical flow of the statement.

1. The sentence starts with ""Jon is still trying to kick Paul out"" - this establishes Jon as the subject and the one taking action against Paul.

2. The second part of the sentence, connected by ""but,"" introduces a contrasting idea: ""he wants his help.""

3. Given that Jon is trying to kick Paul out, it wouldn't make sense for Jon to want Paul's help. This contradiction suggests that ""he"" refers to Paul.

4. It's more logical that Paul, who is being kicked out, would want Jon's help, possibly to stay or for some other reason.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Paul in this context.",1,1
1652,"Nadja was given to Miss Applefield to raise when she was a baby, her only possession at the time being an elaborated heart-shaped brooch.",she,"0: Nadja, 1: Miss Applefield, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Nadja was given to Miss Applefield to raise...""
2. This implies that Nadja is the one being raised, not Miss Applefield.
3. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""when she was a baby.""
4. It's more logical that Nadja was a baby when given to Miss Applefield, rather than Miss Applefield being a baby at that time.
5. The possession of the brooch is also more likely to belong to Nadja as a baby, rather than Miss Applefield.

Based on these points, it's clear that the pronoun ""she"" refers to Nadja, not Miss Applefield.",0,0
1653,"An enraged Tarabas attempts to kill Darken, but Xellesia arrives and stops him.",him,"0: Darken, 1: An enraged Tarabas, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""him"" refers to Darken. The context indicates that Tarabas is attempting to kill someone, and that someone is Darken. The pronoun ""him"" is used as the object of the verb ""kill,"" which aligns with Darken being the target of Tarabas's action. Additionally, Xellesia arrives to stop Tarabas, further confirming that Darken is the one being protected from harm. Therefore, ""him"" refers to Darken, which is candidate 0.",0,0
1654,"Pratap is miserable without Kushal, but he is too proud to ask him back.",he,"0: Kushal, 1: Pratap, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Pratap is miserable without Kushal.""
2. Then it continues with ""but he is too proud to ask him back.""

The pronoun ""he"" is more likely to refer to Pratap for the following reasons:
1. Pratap is the subject of the first clause and the main focus of the sentence.
2. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" is the same person who is miserable (Pratap).
3. The phrase ""ask him back"" implies that ""he"" (the subject) is asking someone else (Kushal) to come back.
4. It would make more sense for Pratap to be the one who is too proud to ask Kushal back, given that Pratap is described as miserable without Kushal.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Pratap.",0,1
1655,Dickson was bowled by Richard Ollivierre but the bails took several seconds to fall and he was given not out by the umpire.,he,"0: Dickson, 1: Richard Ollivierre, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""he"" refers to. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the context of being given ""not out"" by the umpire. In cricket, the batsman is the one who can be given out or not out. In this case, Dickson is mentioned as the batsman who was bowled, so ""he"" most likely refers to Dickson.

Richard Ollivierre is mentioned as the bowler, and bowlers are not typically given out or not out by the umpire in this context. Therefore, ""he"" cannot refer to Richard Ollivierre.

The pronoun ""he"" clearly refers to one of the mentioned individuals and not to an unmentioned third party, so ""Neither"" is not the correct answer.

Based on this reasoning, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Dickson.",0,0
1656,"Yifei goes about to woo Kishori, so that she can get the letters possessed by her.",she,"0: Yifei, 1: Kishori, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Yifei is the subject of the sentence and is performing the action of wooing Kishori.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""so that she can get the letters possessed by her.""
3. The action of getting the letters is likely the motivation for the wooing.
4. It makes more sense that Yifei would be trying to get letters from Kishori, rather than Kishori trying to get letters from herself.

Given this reasoning, it's most logical that ""she"" refers to Yifei. Yifei is wooing Kishori with the intention of obtaining letters that Kishori possesses.",0,0
1657,"Lynch was quickly signed by the owner of the Denver Broncos, where he had consecutive injury-free Pro Bowl seasons.",he,"0: Lynch, 1: the owner of the Denver Broncos, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" clearly refers to Lynch, not the owner of the Denver Broncos. The sentence is describing Lynch's career progression, stating that after being signed by the Broncos' owner, Lynch had consecutive injury-free Pro Bowl seasons. The pronoun ""he"" is used to continue talking about Lynch's achievements, not about the owner. The structure of the sentence and the context make it clear that Lynch is the subject being discussed throughout.",0,0
1658,Hunter was shot dead and Cottle was so severely wounded that he died soon thereafter.,he,"0: Hunter, 1: Cottle, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which person the pronoun ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Hunter was shot dead.
2. Cottle was severely wounded.
3. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the phrase ""he died soon thereafter.""

Given this information, we can deduce that ""he"" refers to Cottle for the following reasons:
- Hunter was already described as ""shot dead,"" which implies immediate death.
- Cottle was described as ""severely wounded,"" which suggests he was still alive initially.
- The phrase ""he died soon thereafter"" indicates that someone who was initially alive then died shortly after being wounded.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Cottle, who was severely wounded and then died soon after.",0,1
1659,Sheng Da is confused since Da Li looks so much like the boy he had fallen in love with.,he,"0: Da Li, 1: Sheng Da, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" clearly refers to Sheng Da. The sentence is describing Sheng Da's state of confusion and his feelings towards Da Li. The structure of the sentence indicates that Sheng Da is the subject who is experiencing the confusion, and Da Li is the object of his attention. The pronoun ""he"" is used to refer back to Sheng Da, who had fallen in love with someone in the past. Therefore, the correct answer is 1, which corresponds to Sheng Da.",0,1
1660,"Jacky is surprised that Rachel does not come, and is even more surprised when she realizes that Higgins is not there either.",she,"0: Jacky, 1: Rachel, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and sentence structure:

1. The sentence mentions two female characters: Jacky and Rachel.
2. The pronoun ""she"" appears in the clause ""when she realizes that Higgins is not there either.""
3. The subject of the main clause is Jacky, who is described as being surprised.
4. The sentence structure suggests that the same person (Jacky) who is surprised about Rachel not coming is also the one who realizes Higgins is not there.

Based on this analysis, it is most likely that ""she"" refers to Jacky. The sentence is describing Jacky's reactions and realizations, making her the most logical antecedent for the pronoun ""she.""",0,0

3. This clause provides additional information about the subject of the main clause, which is Nampaduvan.
4. It wouldn't make sense for this information to be about Lord Nambi, as deities are not typically described as being born into social classes.
5. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" refers back to the subject of the main clause, Nampaduvan.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Nampaduvan.",0,0
1662,"Emilia does not particularly like Anna, but tries to be a good parent to her.",her,"0: Emilia, 1: Anna, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""her"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Emilia is mentioned first as the subject of the sentence.
2. Anna is mentioned second as the object of Emilia's feelings.
3. The pronoun ""her"" appears in the phrase ""be a good parent to her.""

Given this information, we can deduce that ""her"" refers to Anna for the following reasons:
- Emilia is described as trying to be a good parent, which implies that ""her"" refers to Emilia's child.
- It wouldn't make sense for Emilia to be trying to be a good parent to herself.
- The sentence structure suggests that Anna is the recipient of Emilia's parenting efforts.

Therefore, the pronoun ""her"" most likely refers to Anna.",1,1
1663,"Emilia attempts a reconciliation with Adah, but she eventually decides to leave her and the town.",she,"0: Emilia, 1: Adah, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""she"" refers to: Emilia or Adah. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""she eventually decides to leave her and the town."" 

Let's analyze the context:
1. Emilia is the subject of the first part of the sentence, attempting reconciliation.
2. The action of leaving is more likely to be performed by the person attempting reconciliation (Emilia) rather than the person being reconciled with (Adah).
3. The phrase ""leave her"" implies that ""she"" is leaving someone else, which would be Adah in this context.

Given these points, it's clear that ""she"" refers to Emilia, as she is the one making the decision to leave both Adah and the town.",1,0
1664,"Elizabeth attempts to reconcile with Amelia, but she says they do not have a future together.",she,"0: Elizabeth, 1: Amelia, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Amelia. The context suggests that Elizabeth is making an attempt to reconcile, but the person responding negatively is the other party in the conversation. The structure of the sentence implies that ""she"" is the one saying they don't have a future together, which is more likely to be Amelia's response to Elizabeth's reconciliation attempt.",1,1
1665,"Anthony shoots at Ali, but he shields himself with the canap tray, which reflects the shot at Jocelyn and kills him.",he,"0: Anthony, 1: Ali, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. ""Anthony shoots at Ali"" - This establishes Anthony as the shooter and Ali as the target.
2. ""but he shields himself"" - The pronoun ""he"" here refers to the person being shot at, which is Ali. This is because it wouldn't make sense for Anthony to shield himself from his own shot.
3. ""with the canap tray"" - This further confirms that ""he"" refers to Ali, as Ali would be the one using the tray as a shield.
4. ""which reflects the shot at Jocelyn and kills him"" - This part is not relevant to determining who ""he"" refers to in the earlier part of the sentence.

Given this analysis, it's clear that the pronoun ""he"" in this context refers to Ali, who is shielding himself from Anthony's shot.",1,1
1666,"Anna decides to dig up Gigi, to see if she is indeed alive.",she,"0: Anna, 1: Gigi, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who the pronoun ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Anna is the subject of the sentence and is performing the action of digging up Gigi.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""to see if she is indeed alive.""
3. Logically, Anna wouldn't be digging herself up to see if she (Anna) is alive.
4. The purpose of Anna's action is to check on Gigi's status.

Therefore, it makes more sense that ""she"" refers to Gigi, as Anna is trying to determine if Gigi is alive. The pronoun ""she"" is used to avoid repeating Gigi's name in the sentence.",1,1
1667,Bobby Z knows Don Huertero wo n't rest until he believes him dead.,he,"0: Bobby Z, 1: Don Huertero, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who the pronoun ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Bobby Z is the subject of the sentence.
2. Don Huertero is mentioned as someone who won't rest.
3. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the phrase ""until he believes him dead.""

Given this context, it's clear that ""he"" refers to Don Huertero. The sentence is stating that Bobby Z knows that Don Huertero won't rest until Don Huertero believes Bobby Z is dead. This interpretation makes the most logical sense in the context of the sentence.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Don Huertero, which is candidate 1.",1,1
1668,"Komamura has a close friendship with Kaname Tsen and is shocked when the latter defects from Soul Society, feeling that his friend has abandoned his morals.",his,"0: Komamura, 1: Kaname Tsen, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""his"" refers to Kaname Tsen. The context indicates that Komamura is shocked by Kaname Tsen's defection from Soul Society, and the phrase ""feeling that his friend has abandoned his morals"" suggests that it is Kaname Tsen's morals that are being referred to. Komamura is the one feeling shocked and disappointed, while Kaname Tsen is the one who has defected and apparently abandoned his morals. Therefore, ""his"" in this context refers to Kaname Tsen.",1,1
1669,"Julia does not want to come as Laura is not invited, but she changes her mind.",her,"0: Julia, 1: Laura, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""her"" refers to Julia. The reasoning is as follows:

1. The sentence structure indicates that someone is changing their mind.
2. The first part of the sentence states that ""Julia does not want to come.""
3. The second part, after the ""but,"" suggests a change in the initial decision.
4. Therefore, ""she changes her mind"" refers back to Julia, who initially didn't want to come.

Laura is mentioned in the sentence, but she is not the subject of the action of changing one's mind. The pronoun ""her"" in this context is clearly referring to Julia's mind that is being changed.",0,0
1670,"Tris finds herself attracted to Laura but is confused, not sure what to do with her emotions.",her,"0: Tris, 1: Laura, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""her"" refers to Tris's emotions, not to either Tris or Laura directly. The sentence is describing Tris's internal state and confusion about her own feelings. The phrase ""her emotions"" indicates that these are Tris's emotions that she is unsure how to handle. Therefore, the pronoun ""her"" doesn't directly refer to either of the candidates mentioned.",1,2
1671,"Tamako begins on the bridge to save Mokichi, but she is too heavy on the unstable bridge.",she,"0: Tamako, 1: Mokichi, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" clearly refers to Tamako for the following reasons:

1. Tamako is the subject of the first part of the sentence, establishing her as the main actor.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the second part of the sentence to continue describing an action or state related to the subject.
3. The sentence is describing Tamako's attempt to save Mokichi, and then provides additional information about Tamako (being too heavy for the bridge).
4. Mokichi is mentioned as the object of Tamako's action (to save), not as the subject performing any action.
5. Grammatically, ""she"" is a feminine pronoun, which aligns with Tamako (typically a female name) rather than Mokichi (typically a male name).

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" in this context refers to Tamako.",1,0
1672,"Higuchi appears and is now ready to fight Zoucho, but still afraid, she cowers.",she,"0: Higuchi, 1: Zoucho, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" clearly refers to Higuchi. The sentence states that ""Higuchi appears"" and then describes her actions using ""she"". The sentence mentions that ""she cowers"" which is consistent with the earlier description of Higuchi being ""still afraid"". Zoucho is only mentioned as the person Higuchi is ready to fight, but no actions are attributed to Zoucho. Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" must be referring to Higuchi.",0,0
1673,"Naji is supposed to come over for a visit with Khalil, but he does n't come.",he,"0: Naji, 1: Khalil, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Naji for the following reasons:

1. Naji is mentioned first in the sentence, making him the primary subject.
2. The sentence structure suggests that Naji is the one who is supposed to visit Khalil.
3. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the context of not coming, which aligns with the expectation set for Naji to visit.

While Khalil is mentioned, he is presented as the person being visited, not the one who doesn't come. Therefore, it's more logical to conclude that ""he"" refers to Naji.",1,0
1674,Emma Barnes gets in touch with Rebecca when she learns she is his biological mother.,she,"0: Rebecca, 1: Emma Barnes, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. The pronoun ""she"" appears twice in the sentence.
2. The first ""she"" refers to Emma Barnes, as she is the one who ""gets in touch with Rebecca.""
3. The second ""she"" also refers to Emma Barnes, as it states ""she learns she is his biological mother.""
4. The use of ""his"" in this context is likely a typo and should be ""her,"" as we're talking about a mother-child relationship between two women.
5. Rebecca is mentioned as the person Emma Barnes contacts, and is revealed to be Emma's biological mother.

Given this analysis, both instances of ""she"" in the sentence refer to Emma Barnes. The pronoun ""she"" does not refer to Rebecca in this context.",1,1
1675,"John allows Paul to move back home after he agrees to take six months off from Lassiter's, placing Declan in charge.",he,"0: John, 1: Paul, 2: Neither","To determine who the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and logical flow of the sentence:

1. John is allowing Paul to move back home.
2. This allowance is conditional on someone agreeing to take six months off from Lassiter's.
3. The pronoun ""he"" is used to refer to the person who agrees to this condition.

Given this information, it's more logical that Paul is the one agreeing to take time off from work in order to be allowed to move back home. John, being the one allowing Paul to move back, is likely not the one taking time off.

Therefore, ""he"" most likely refers to Paul.",1,1
1676,"Ali tells Paul, but he does not believe him.",he,"0: Ali, 1: Paul, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Ali tells Paul,"" establishing Ali as the subject and Paul as the object of the telling action.

2. The pronoun ""he"" appears in the second part of the sentence: ""but he does not believe him.""

3. Logically, the person who doesn't believe would be the one who was told something, not the one doing the telling.

4. In this case, Paul is the one being told something by Ali, so it makes more sense that Paul is the one who doesn't believe.

5. The pronoun ""him"" at the end of the sentence likely refers back to Ali, further supporting that ""he"" refers to Paul.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Paul in this context.",1,1
1677,"Samantha deals with this much better than Naomi, even supporting the marriage between Maya and Dink, though she is certainly not pleased with the circumstances.",she,"0: Samantha, 1: Naomi, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and sentence structure:

1. The sentence compares Samantha's reaction to Naomi's.
2. It mentions that Samantha deals with ""this"" better than Naomi.
3. The pronoun ""she"" appears in the latter part of the sentence, which provides additional information about the subject's feelings.
4. The sentence structure suggests that ""she"" refers to the person who is supporting the marriage despite not being pleased with the circumstances.

Given these points, it's clear that ""she"" refers to Samantha. Samantha is the one who is described as dealing with the situation better and supporting the marriage, even though she is not pleased with the circumstances. The pronoun ""she"" is used to avoid repeating Samantha's name while providing additional information about her reaction.",0,0
1678,Zana started to work as a tailor with Christian Dior after he graduated from elementary school.,he,"0: Zana, 1: Christian Dior, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence is about Zana's career progression.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""after he graduated from elementary school.""
3. Graduating from elementary school is typically associated with a young person's life event.
4. Christian Dior is mentioned as Zana's employer, not as the subject of the graduation.
5. It's more logical that the sentence is describing Zana's early career, starting after his own graduation.

Given these points, it's most likely that ""he"" refers to Zana, not Christian Dior. The pronoun is used to avoid repeating Zana's name in the same sentence.",1,0
1679,"Richard was probably the son of Robert de Courcy, but his mother was named Herleva.",his,"0: Richard, 1: Robert de Courcy, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which person the pronoun ""his"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence is primarily about Richard.
2. Richard is mentioned first, making him the primary subject.
3. The pronoun ""his"" is used in reference to the mother.
4. It would be more logical for the sentence to be discussing Richard's mother rather than Robert de Courcy's mother, given the structure and focus of the sentence.

Based on these points, it's most likely that ""his"" refers to Richard. The sentence is providing information about Richard's parentage, stating that Robert de Courcy was probably his father, and then giving information about his mother.",0,0
1680,"Ashraf Khan is blackmailed to release Gani Bhai, after his men release an explicit video of his daughter online.",his,"0: Ashraf Khan, 1: Gani Bhai, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""his"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. Ashraf Khan is the subject of the sentence and the main person being discussed.
2. The pronoun ""his"" is used twice in the sentence:
   a. ""his men"" - This likely refers to Gani Bhai's men, as they are the ones releasing the video.
   b. ""his daughter"" - This clearly refers to Ashraf Khan's daughter, as he is the one being blackmailed.

Given that the question asks about the pronoun ""his"" without specifying which instance, we need to consider both uses. However, the more significant and clear reference is to Ashraf Khan's daughter. This makes Ashraf Khan the most likely candidate that the pronoun ""his"" refers to in this context.",0,0
1681,"Asin Thottumkal was first approached for the role of Jhanvi, but due to other commitments she rejected the offer.",she,"0: Jhanvi, 1: Asin Thottumkal, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" refers to Asin Thottumkal. The sentence structure indicates that Asin Thottumkal was approached for a role, but she (Asin Thottumkal) rejected the offer due to other commitments. The pronoun ""she"" is used to avoid repeating Asin Thottumkal's name in the second part of the sentence. Jhanvi is mentioned as the role that was offered, not as the person who rejected it.",0,1
1682,"Gubacsi was originally coached by Jozsef Hegedus, but he would later be replaced by Attila Door.",he,"0: Gubacsi, 1: Jozsef Hegedus, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Gubacsi"" as the subject.
2. Jozsef Hegedus is mentioned as Gubacsi's original coach.
3. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""but he would later be replaced.""

Given this information, it's clear that ""he"" refers to Jozsef Hegedus, not Gubacsi. The sentence is describing a change in Gubacsi's coaching situation, where Jozsef Hegedus was replaced by Attila Door. It wouldn't make sense for Gubacsi to be replaced in this context.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Jozsef Hegedus.",1,1
1683,Meanwhile Dylan continues to hunt Aidan but he is surprised from behind by Aidan.,he,"0: Dylan, 1: Aidan, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Dylan. The context suggests that Dylan is hunting Aidan, and then something unexpected happens to Dylan. The phrase ""he is surprised from behind by Aidan"" indicates that Dylan, who was doing the hunting, is the one who gets surprised. It wouldn't make sense for Aidan to be surprised by himself, so ""he"" must refer to Dylan in this case.",0,0
1684,Hollywood writer Charlie Sorrel is shot and killed by Hungarian film producer Sir Leopold Sartori when he is caught fooling around with his wife.,he,"0: Hungarian film producer Sir Leopold Sartori, 1: Hollywood writer Charlie Sorrel, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions two male individuals: Charlie Sorrel and Sir Leopold Sartori.
2. The pronoun ""he"" appears in the clause ""when he is caught fooling around with his wife.""
3. The sentence structure suggests that Sir Leopold Sartori is the one doing the shooting, while Charlie Sorrel is the one being shot.
4. Logically, it makes more sense that Charlie Sorrel (the one being shot) is the one caught fooling around with Sir Leopold Sartori's wife.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Charlie Sorrel, as he is the one being caught in the act that leads to his death.",1,1
1685,Zu Ji was the eldest son of King Wu Ding but despite his kingly title he never succeeded his father as a Shang dynasty King of China.,his,"0: King Wu Ding, 1: Zu Ji, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""his"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence. The pronoun ""his"" appears in the phrase ""despite his kingly title."" This title is being attributed to Zu Ji, not King Wu Ding. The sentence is explaining that even though Zu Ji had a kingly title, he did not succeed his father as king. Therefore, ""his"" refers to Zu Ji.",0,1
1686,Smith does away with Whitey but gives his old friend Sinclair a last chance.,his,"0: Smith, 1: Whitey, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""his"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions three people: Smith, Whitey, and Sinclair.
2. Smith is the subject of the sentence and is performing the actions.
3. The pronoun ""his"" is used in the phrase ""his old friend Sinclair.""
4. It's more likely that Smith would be giving a last chance to his old friend, rather than Whitey (who is being ""done away with"") giving a last chance to someone.
5. The possessive pronoun ""his"" is more naturally associated with the subject of the sentence (Smith) rather than the object (Whitey).

Based on these observations, it's most logical that ""his"" refers to Smith, as Smith is the one giving Sinclair a last chance, and Sinclair is described as ""his old friend.""",0,0
1687,"Emma finally agrees to put Jennifer ashore, but after she has given her sleeping pills.",she,"0: Emma, 1: Jennifer, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to when it says ""after she has given her sleeping pills."" Let's analyze the context:

1. Emma is the subject of the main clause, agreeing to put Jennifer ashore.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the subordinate clause describing an action taken before putting Jennifer ashore.
3. The sentence structure implies that ""she"" (the giver of sleeping pills) and ""her"" (the receiver of sleeping pills) are two different people.

Given this information, it's most logical that Emma is the one giving the sleeping pills to Jennifer. Emma is in control of the situation, agreeing to put Jennifer ashore, and the action of giving sleeping pills aligns with this control. Therefore, ""she"" in this context refers to Emma.",0,0
1688,Richard promised to wait until Harry returned but he was later reported missing in action and presumed dead.,he,"0: Richard, 1: Harry, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Richard promised to wait until Harry returned.""
2. Then it continues with ""but he was later reported missing in action and presumed dead.""

The pronoun ""he"" is more likely to refer to Harry for the following reasons:
1. The sentence structure suggests a contrast or unexpected outcome (indicated by ""but"") after mentioning Harry's return.
2. The phrase ""missing in action"" typically refers to soldiers or personnel in conflict zones, which aligns more with someone who was returning (Harry) rather than someone who was waiting (Richard).
3. If Richard was the one reported missing, it would be odd to mention him waiting for Harry's return, as that action would be interrupted by Richard's own disappearance.

Therefore, based on the context and logical flow of the sentence, ""he"" most likely refers to Harry.",1,1
1689,"Fernando eventually grows tired of Enrico constantly talking about Sonia, so he tells him to tell her how he feels.",he,"0: Enrico, 1: Fernando, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""he"" refers to: Enrico or Fernando. Let's analyze the context:

1. Fernando is tired of Enrico talking about Sonia.
2. Fernando tells ""him"" to tell ""her"" how ""he"" feels.

The pronoun ""he"" in question is part of the phrase ""how he feels."" This clearly refers to Enrico's feelings for Sonia, not Fernando's. Fernando is the one giving advice to Enrico about expressing his feelings to Sonia.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" in this context refers to Enrico.",1,0
1690,Joanne is attracted to Louise's father Phil Mitchell and is sacked when she tries to seduce him.,she,"0: Joanne, 1: Louise 's father Phil Mitchell, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" refers to Joanne. We can determine this because:

1. Joanne is the subject of the first part of the sentence.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the context of trying to seduce Phil Mitchell.
3. It makes logical sense that Joanne, who is attracted to Phil Mitchell, would be the one trying to seduce him.
4. The consequence of the seduction attempt (being sacked) is more likely to apply to Joanne than to Louise or Phil Mitchell.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" clearly refers to Joanne, which is candidate 0.",0,0
1691,"Mary initially agrees to meet with Derek, but shuts the door in his face when he arrives at her house.",his,"0: Mary, 1: Derek, 2: Neither","The pronoun ""his"" in this sentence clearly refers to Derek. The sentence describes a situation where Mary shuts the door in ""his"" face when ""he"" arrives at her house. Since Derek is the one arriving at Mary's house, ""his"" and ""he"" must refer to Derek. Mary is referred to with feminine pronouns (""her house""), so ""his"" cannot refer to Mary.",1,1
1692,"Sean thought Elizabeth did n't want to come, so he invited another girl, Amy Nielsen.",he,"0: Sean, 1: Elizabeth, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" clearly refers to Sean. The sentence structure indicates that Sean is the subject who performed the action of inviting Amy Nielsen. The pronoun ""he"" is used to avoid repeating Sean's name in the second part of the sentence. Elizabeth is mentioned, but she is the object of Sean's thoughts, not the subject performing the action. Therefore, ""he"" must refer to Sean.",0,0
1693,"Renee tries to warn Lucie, but Vladimir chokes her, taking the phone away from her.",her,"0: Renee, 1: Lucie, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""her"" is used twice, and in both cases, it refers to Renee. Let's break it down:

1. ""Vladimir chokes her"": This action is happening to Renee, as she is the one trying to warn Lucie. It wouldn't make sense for Vladimir to choke Lucie in this context.

2. ""taking the phone away from her"": Again, this refers to Renee. She is the one who was trying to warn Lucie, so she must have been holding the phone.

The sentence structure and context clearly indicate that Renee is the subject of these actions, and therefore, the pronoun ""her"" refers to Renee in both instances.",0,0
1694,Bradley Branning asks Preeti out after Deano Wicks is unsuccessful in chatting her up.,her,"0: Preeti, 1: Bradley Branning, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""her"" clearly refers to Preeti. The sentence describes two actions involving Preeti:
1. Deano Wicks unsuccessfully tries to chat her up.
2. Bradley Branning asks her out.

1. Gender agreement: ""he"" is a masculine pronoun, which matches with ""Warren Stamp"" (a male name) rather than ""Preeti"" (typically a female name).

2. Subject-action relationship: The sentence states that ""he attacks her,"" indicating that the pronoun ""he"" is performing the action of attacking. This action is attributed to Warren Stamp, not Preeti.

3. Logical flow: The sentence introduces Preeti going on a date with Warren Stamp, then immediately uses ""he"" to describe an action. This natural progression suggests that ""he"" refers to the most recently mentioned male individual, which is Warren Stamp.

4. Object pronoun: The sentence uses ""her"" to refer to Preeti, which further confirms that ""he"" must refer to the other person mentioned, Warren Stamp.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" refers to candidate 1, salesman Warren Stamp.",1,"1

The context clearly indicates that Joanne is the subject of the action described. The sentence states that ""Joanne is attracted to Louise's father Phil Mitchell"" and then continues with ""and is sacked when she tries to seduce him.""

Louise is only mentioned as a reference point to identify Phil Mitchell as her father, and is not the subject of the actions described.",0,0
1697,"Olivia thought Elizabeth did n't want to come, so she invited another girl, Amy Nielsen.",she,"0: Olivia, 1: Elizabeth, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Olivia is the subject of the main clause and is performing the action of thinking.
2. Elizabeth is mentioned as the person Olivia thought didn't want to come.
3. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the second part of the sentence, where someone is inviting Amy Nielsen.

Given this information, it's most logical that ""she"" refers to Olivia. The sentence structure suggests that Olivia, after thinking Elizabeth didn't want to come, took the action of inviting someone else. This follows a natural flow of thought and action from the same person (Olivia).

It's unlikely that ""she"" refers to Elizabeth because Elizabeth is presented as the person who doesn't want to come, so it wouldn't make sense for her to be inviting someone else.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Olivia.",0,0
1698,"Rusty struggles at first, often getting into arguments with Peggy, although Beattie helps her find a friend in local schoolgirl Beth.",her,"0: Rusty, 1: Peggy, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""her"" most likely refers to Rusty. The sentence structure suggests that Beattie is helping Rusty, not Peggy, to find a friend. This interpretation makes the most sense in the context of the sentence, as it follows the mention of Rusty's struggles and arguments with Peggy. The pronoun ""her"" is used to avoid repeating Rusty's name in the same sentence.",1,0
1699,"Jeffrey unzips in front of Luke, but the only thing visible to him are his green feet.",him,"0: Jeffrey, 1: Luke, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""him"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. Jeffrey is the subject of the first clause, performing the action of unzipping.
2. Luke is mentioned as being in front of Jeffrey.
3. The second clause states ""the only thing visible to him are his green feet.""

The pronoun ""him"" is more likely to refer to Luke because:
a) It's more natural for Luke to be observing Jeffrey's actions.
b) If ""him"" referred to Jeffrey, it would imply Jeffrey is seeing his own feet, which is less likely given the context of unzipping in front of someone else.
c) The sentence structure suggests a shift in perspective from Jeffrey's action to what Luke can see.

Therefore, the pronoun ""him"" most likely refers to Luke.",1,1

1. Naohiro is mentioned first as the subject of the sentence.
2. Nagai Naotsune is mentioned as Naohiro's father.
3. The pronoun ""his"" appears in the phrase ""his father's death.""

Given this information, it's clear that ""his"" refers to Naohiro. The sentence is stating that Naohiro assumed family headship after the death of his (Naohiro's) father. It wouldn't make sense for ""his"" to refer to Nagai Naotsune, as that would imply Nagai Naotsune's father, which is not mentioned or relevant in this context.

Therefore, the pronoun ""his"" refers to Naohiro (candidate 0).",0,0
1701,"Charlie kills Christopher, but he is in turn killed by Emmy.",he,"0: Charlie, 1: Christopher, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the structure:

1. ""Charlie kills Christopher"" - This is the first action.
2. ""but he is in turn killed by Emmy"" - This is the second action, connected by ""but,"" indicating a contrast or consequence.

The pronoun ""he"" is used in the second part of the sentence. It refers to the person who is killed by Emmy. To determine who this is, we need to consider the logical flow of events:

1. Charlie kills Christopher.
2. Then, someone (""he"") is killed by Emmy.

Given this sequence, it makes more sense that Emmy would kill Charlie in retaliation for Charlie killing Christopher. If ""he"" referred to Christopher, it would be redundant since Christopher was already killed by Charlie.

Therefore, ""he"" most likely refers to Charlie.",0,0
1702,"Paul tries to explain himself to Dan, but he leaves the brunch without him.",he,"0: Paul, 1: Dan, 2: Neither","To determine who ""he"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and the actions described:

1. Paul is trying to explain himself to Dan.
2. Someone leaves the brunch without the other person.

The pronoun ""he"" is more likely to refer to Dan for the following reasons:
- Paul is the subject of the first clause, actively trying to explain himself.
- The second clause introduces a new action (leaving) performed by ""he.""
- It would be more natural for Dan to leave while Paul is trying to explain, rather than Paul leaving in the middle of his own explanation.
- The phrase ""without him"" at the end suggests that Paul is left behind, further indicating that Dan is the one who leaves.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Dan.",1,1
1703,"Janae hits Emma to protect herself, when she escapes she is the one charged with assault.",she,"0: Janae, 1: Emma, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. ""Janae hits Emma to protect herself"" - Here, ""herself"" likely refers to Janae, as she is the subject of the sentence and the one performing the action of hitting.

2. ""when she escapes"" - This is the part we need to focus on. The pronoun ""she"" is ambiguous and could refer to either Janae or Emma.

3. ""she is the one charged with assault"" - This provides a crucial clue. It's more likely that the person who did the hitting (Janae) would be charged with assault, rather than the person who was hit (Emma).

Given this reasoning, it's most probable that ""she"" refers to Janae throughout the sentence. Janae hits Emma, Janae escapes, and then Janae is charged with assault.",0,0
1704,The applicants soon discover that the patients act as if their dead mother is in the room.,their,"0: the patients, 1: The applicants, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""their"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. ""The applicants"" is the subject of the sentence.
2. ""the patients"" is part of the object of the sentence.
3. The pronoun ""their"" is used in the phrase ""their dead mother,"" which implies ownership or relation.

Given the context, it's more logical that the patients would be acting as if their own dead mother is in the room, rather than the applicants' dead mother. The sentence is describing the behavior of the patients, not the applicants.

Therefore, ""their"" most likely refers to ""the patients.""",0,0
1705,"John was convicted and Hainer was acquitted, possibly because he had made a deal with Franc to sell out his friend.",he,"0: John, 1: Hainer, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Hainer for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" is the subject of the clause ""he had made a deal with Franc.""
2. This clause provides an explanation for why Hainer was acquitted, while John was convicted.
3. It would not make sense for ""he"" to refer to John in this context, as John was convicted and the deal is presented as a reason for acquittal.
4. The pronoun ""he"" is closer to ""Hainer"" in the sentence, which is often (though not always) an indicator of the pronoun's referent.

Therefore, based on the context and logical flow of the sentence, ""he"" most likely refers to Hainer.",1,1
1706,"Lady Salmakia dies very shortly after Tialys, when the last of her energy has run out.",her,"0: Tialys, 1: Lady Salmakia, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""her"" clearly refers to Lady Salmakia. The sentence is describing Lady Salmakia's death, which occurs after Tialys's death. The phrase ""her energy"" is directly referring to Lady Salmakia's energy, not Tialys's. Therefore, the pronoun ""her"" is referring to Lady Salmakia.",1,1
1707,Robin goes to speak to Gael but discovers he has invited more backpackers to stay with them.,he,"0: Robin, 1: Gael, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Gael for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure suggests that Robin is the subject who goes to speak to Gael.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the latter part of the sentence, which is describing an action (inviting more backpackers) that is separate from Robin's initial action.
3. It would be more natural for the sentence to use ""Robin"" again if it was referring to Robin's action of inviting backpackers.
4. The use of ""them"" at the end of the sentence implies that Robin is part of the group that the backpackers are staying with, further suggesting that Gael is the one who invited the backpackers.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Gael (candidate 1).",0,1
1708,John is friendly with Larry but he recalls again the advice of Rollie and keeps his distance.,he,"0: Larry, 1: John, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""John is friendly with Larry"".
2. The pronoun ""he"" appears after ""but"", indicating a contrast or additional information about one of the previously mentioned individuals.
3. The action associated with ""he"" is ""recalls again the advice of Rollie"".
4. The sentence ends with ""keeps his distance"", which is likely related to the same person who recalls the advice.

Given this analysis, it's more likely that ""he"" refers to John because:
a) John is the subject of the first part of the sentence.
b) The action of recalling advice and keeping distance seems to be a continuation of John's perspective or actions.
c) It would make more sense for John to keep his distance from Larry (the object in the first part) rather than Larry keeping distance from himself.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to John.",0,1
1709,"Abby wants to get rid of Elizabeth May so that she can have Charles, Elizabeth's well-to-do husband.",she,"0: Abby, 1: Elizabeth May, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" clearly refers to Abby. The context indicates that Abby is the one who wants to get rid of Elizabeth May in order to have Charles. The pronoun ""she"" is used to avoid repeating Abby's name and maintains the focus on Abby's intentions. Elizabeth May is mentioned as the person Abby wants to get rid of, so ""she"" cannot refer to Elizabeth May. Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" refers to candidate 0, Abby.",1,0
1710,Sean Penn was already set to play Larry Fine but he dropped out to concentrate on his charitable efforts in Haiti.,his,"0: Sean Penn, 1: Larry Fine, 2: Neither","The pronoun ""his"" in this sentence refers to Sean Penn. The sentence is discussing Sean Penn's actions, stating that he dropped out of playing Larry Fine to focus on his own charitable efforts in Haiti. The pronoun ""his"" is directly connected to Sean Penn's decision and subsequent actions, not to Larry Fine or any other person mentioned in the text.",0,0
1711,"Inada is highly estimated by Abe because of her political and historical beliefs, which are close to Abe's.",her,"0: Inada, 1: Abe, 2: Neither","The pronoun ""her"" in this sentence refers to Inada for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure indicates that Inada is the subject being estimated by Abe.
2. ""Her"" is used in reference to political and historical beliefs, which are attributed to the person being estimated (Inada).
3. The sentence compares these beliefs to Abe's, implying that ""her"" refers to someone other than Abe.
4. Inada is the only female name mentioned in the text, and ""her"" is a feminine pronoun.

Therefore, the pronoun ""her"" clearly refers to Inada (candidate 0) and not to Abe (candidate 1) or any other person not mentioned in the text.",0,0
1712,"Tina is scared, but Emma comes after her and protects herself with a gun.",her,"0: Tina, 1: Emma, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""her"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Tina is mentioned first and is described as being scared.
2. Emma is mentioned second and is described as coming after ""her"".
3. The pronoun ""her"" is used in the phrase ""comes after her"".

Given this information, it's clear that ""her"" refers to Tina. Emma is the one doing the action (coming after), while Tina is the one being pursued. This makes sense with Tina being described as scared at the beginning of the sentence.

The fact that Emma ""protects herself"" with a gun further confirms that ""her"" earlier in the sentence cannot refer to Emma, as it would not make sense for Emma to come after herself.

Therefore, the pronoun ""her"" in this context refers to Tina.",0,0
1713,"Lingad was defeated by Estelito Mendoza, but he raised charges of fraud which led to the staging of a new election for governor.",he,"0: Lingad, 1: Estelito Mendoza, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Lingad. The reasoning is as follows:

1. The sentence structure indicates that Lingad is the main subject of the action following the pronoun.
2. It states that ""he raised charges of fraud,"" which is more likely to be an action taken by the defeated candidate (Lingad) rather than the victor (Estelito Mendoza).
3. The context suggests that Lingad, as the losing candidate, would be the one to challenge the election results and call for a new election.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Lingad, which corresponds to candidate 0.",0,0
1714,"Isabella is still smitten with Laura, but she isnt as gullible as she supposes and resists her advances.",she,"0: Isabella, 1: Laura, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""she"" the pronoun refers to. Let's break it down:

1. The first ""she"" in ""she isn't as gullible"" likely refers to Isabella because:
   - Isabella is the subject of the first clause.
   - It makes more sense that Isabella would be resisting Laura's advances, not the other way around.

2. The second ""she"" in ""she supposes"" is more ambiguous, but it's likely to also refer to Isabella because:
   - It's part of the same clause as the first ""she"".
   - It's more logical that Isabella would be supposing something about her own gullibility.

3. The pronoun ""her"" in ""her advances"" clearly refers to Laura, as Isabella is resisting Laura's advances.

Given this analysis, both instances of ""she"" in the sentence most likely refer to Isabella.",1,0
1715,"Curiously, Miles defeated Beliavsky, but he could n't match his ruthlessness in dispatching inferior opposition.",his,"0: Miles, 1: Beliavsky, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence:

1. The pronoun ""his"" is used in the context of ""his ruthlessness in dispatching inferior opposition.""
2. The sentence contrasts Miles' victory over Beliavsky with someone's ruthlessness.
3. The structure of the sentence suggests that the ""ruthlessness"" belongs to Beliavsky, not Miles.
4. It wouldn't make sense for Miles to be unable to match his own ruthlessness.
5. The contrast implies that despite defeating Beliavsky, Miles couldn't match Beliavsky's ruthlessness against weaker opponents.

Therefore, ""his"" most likely refers to Beliavsky.",0,1
1716,Liao Hua surrendered to Sun Quan but later faked his own death and escaped to rejoin Liu Bei.,his,"0: Liao Hua, 1: Sun Quan, 2: Neither","The pronoun ""his"" in this sentence refers to Liao Hua for the following reasons:

1. The sentence is primarily about Liao Hua's actions.
2. The phrase ""faked his own death"" logically refers to Liao Hua, as he is the subject of the sentence and the one performing the actions.
3. The context suggests that Liao Hua is the one who escaped to rejoin Liu Bei, which aligns with him faking his own death.
4. Sun Quan is mentioned only as the person to whom Liao Hua surrendered, and is not the main subject of the sentence.

Therefore, ""his"" most likely refers to Liao Hua (candidate 0) rather than Sun Quan (candidate 1) or neither (candidate 2).",1,0
1717,Thomas tries to coax Chandan but he is firm on his decision to end his relationship with Sunaina.,he,"0: Chandan, 1: Thomas, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Chandan for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure suggests that Thomas is trying to convince or persuade someone, and that someone is Chandan.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in relation to being ""firm on his decision,"" which implies that this person is the one making a decision.
3. The decision being referred to is about ending a relationship with Sunaina, which is more likely to be Chandan's decision rather than Thomas's.
4. It would be unusual for Thomas to be firm on a decision about ending someone else's relationship.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Chandan, who is firm in his decision to end his relationship with Sunaina, despite Thomas's attempts to convince him otherwise.",0,0
1718,Arushi tries to run over Sunaina but she is saved by Yuvi.,she,"0: Sunaina, 1: Arushi, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" refers to Sunaina for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure indicates that Arushi is the subject performing the action of trying to run over Sunaina.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""she is saved by Yuvi,"" which describes what happens to the person being run over.
3. Logically, it makes more sense that Sunaina, the person being targeted, is the one who needs to be saved, rather than Arushi, who is initiating the action.

Therefore, ""she"" in this context refers to Sunaina, who is saved from Arushi's attempt to run her over.",0,0
1719,Arushi does not listen to Sunaina when she tells him that she would return her all the property.,she,"0: Arushi, 1: Sunaina, 2: Neither","Let's analyze the sentence to determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to:

1. The sentence mentions two people: Arushi and Sunaina.
2. The pronoun ""she"" appears twice in the sentence.
3. The first ""she"" is used in the phrase ""when she tells him"". This ""she"" is likely referring to Sunaina, as Sunaina is telling something to Arushi (referred to as ""him"").
4. The second ""she"" is used in ""she would return her all the property"". This ""she"" is also likely referring to Sunaina, as it's a continuation of what Sunaina is telling Arushi.

Based on this analysis, both instances of ""she"" in the sentence refer to Sunaina. The pronoun ""she"" is used to describe the actions of telling and returning, which are attributed to Sunaina in this context.",1,1
1720,"A late attack by Kluge left Newton unable to respond, but he was happy to take a bronze medal at his fourth Olympic Games.",he,"0: Kluge, 1: Newton, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Newton for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure suggests that Newton is the main subject of the second clause.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in relation to being ""happy to take a bronze medal,"" which logically applies to Newton as the athlete who won the medal.
3. The mention of ""his fourth Olympic Games"" further confirms that ""he"" refers to Newton, as it's describing his Olympic experience.
4. Kluge is mentioned as the one who made the late attack, but the focus then shifts to Newton's reaction and achievement.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Newton (candidate 1).",1,1
1721,"Von Hoene could do an uncanny vocal impersonation of horror icon Boris Karloff, and so he was also the off-screen voice announcer for the show.",he,"0: horror icon Boris Karloff, 1: Von Hoene, 2: Neither","The pronoun ""he"" in this context refers to Von Hoene. The sentence structure indicates that Von Hoene is the subject of the entire statement. The text states that ""Von Hoene could do an uncanny vocal impersonation of horror icon Boris Karloff, and so he was also the off-screen voice announcer for the show."" The use of ""and so"" connects the first part of the sentence (about Von Hoene's ability to impersonate Karloff) with the second part (about being the voice announcer). Therefore, ""he"" logically refers back to Von Hoene, who is the main subject of the sentence and the person with the ability being discussed.",0,1
1722,"At first, Emma has a hard time accepting Maria as the not-so-dead Francesca, but she comes around eventually.",she,"0: the not-so-dead Francesca, 1: Emma, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""but she comes around eventually."" Given the context, it's more logical that Emma is the one who comes around to accepting Maria as Francesca, rather than Francesca coming around to accept herself. The sentence structure suggests that Emma is the subject who changes her stance over time. Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Emma.",1,1
1723,Anna does n't necessarily believe Elisabeth but is willing to accept her word for Arno's sake.,her,"0: Anna, 1: Elisabeth, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who the pronoun ""her"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Anna is the subject of the sentence.
2. Elisabeth is mentioned as someone Anna doesn't necessarily believe.
3. The pronoun ""her"" is used in the phrase ""her word,"" which implies that someone's statement or account is being accepted.

Given this information, it's more likely that ""her"" refers to Elisabeth rather than Anna. The sentence structure suggests that Anna is accepting Elisabeth's word, even though she doesn't necessarily believe Elisabeth. It wouldn't make sense for Anna to be accepting her own word.

Therefore, the pronoun ""her"" most likely refers to Elisabeth.",1,1
1724,Andre gets Sean drunk until he falls asleep and then helps Maggie pack Mary's clothes.,he,"0: Andre, 1: Sean, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Andre is the subject of the first part of the sentence.
2. Sean is the object of Andre's action.
3. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""until he falls asleep.""

Given this information, it's more logical that ""he"" refers to Sean because:
- Andre is the one getting Sean drunk, implying that Andre remains conscious and active.
- The natural consequence of getting someone drunk is that they (the person being made drunk) fall asleep.
- It wouldn't make sense for Andre to get Sean drunk and then Andre falls asleep.

Therefore, ""he"" most likely refers to Sean.",1,1
1725,"At first, the actress is not accepted kindly by the women, although the men appear to take a liking to her.",her,"0: the women, 1: the actress, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""her"" clearly refers to ""the actress"" for the following reasons:

1. The sentence is primarily about the actress and how she is received by others.
2. ""Her"" is used in the context of how others (the women and the men) react to this person.
3. Grammatically, ""her"" is a singular feminine pronoun, which matches with ""the actress"" (singular and feminine) but not with ""the women"" (plural).
4. The structure of the sentence suggests that ""her"" is the object of the others' reactions, which logically would be the actress who is new to the situation.

Therefore, the pronoun ""her"" refers to the actress (candidate 1) and not to the women or any other entity not mentioned.",1,1
1726,Tyler feels let down by the corrupt Rathbone but accepts there is nothing else he can do.,he,"0: Tyler, 1: the corrupt Rathbone, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Tyler. We can determine this for the following reasons:

1. Tyler is the subject of the sentence and the main actor in the described situation.
2. The sentence structure suggests that Tyler is the one who ""feels let down"" and ""accepts"" the situation.
3. It would not make sense for ""he"" to refer to ""the corrupt Rathbone"" in this context, as Rathbone is described as the cause of Tyler's disappointment, not the one experiencing the feelings.
4. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the same clause as the actions and feelings attributed to Tyler, indicating a direct connection.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Tyler, which is candidate 0.",0,0
1727,"Originally Emma Lung was to play Venus Hoy, but she pulled out of the project before filming.",she,"0: Emma Lung, 1: Venus Hoy, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" refers to Emma Lung. The sentence structure indicates that Emma Lung was initially cast to play the role of Venus Hoy, but then Emma Lung withdrew from the project. The pronoun ""she"" is used to avoid repeating Emma Lung's name in the second part of the sentence. It's clear that the subject performing the action of pulling out is Emma Lung, not Venus Hoy.",1,0
1728,"Roxy decides to move away, upsetting Ronnie, so she gets Billy Mitchell to rob her salon.",she,"0: Ronnie, 1: Roxy, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Roxy decides to move away"".
2. This action upsets Ronnie.
3. The pronoun ""she"" appears in the clause ""so she gets Billy Mitchell to rob her salon"".

Given this structure, it's more likely that ""she"" refers to Ronnie rather than Roxy. The reasoning is:

1. Ronnie is the subject of the second part of the sentence (the one who is upset).
2. It's more logical that the person who is upset (Ronnie) would take action in response to Roxy moving away.
3. The salon is referred to as ""her salon"", which implies it belongs to Roxy (the one moving away), not the person doing the robbing.

Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Ronnie (candidate 0).",1,0
1729,"Xabi Alonso took the corner which found Garca, but his shot hit the woodwork.",his,"0: Garca, 1: Xabi Alonso, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""his"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Xabi Alonso took the corner.
2. The corner found Garca.
3. ""his shot hit the woodwork.""

The pronoun ""his"" is most likely referring to Garca for the following reasons:
1. Garca is the last mentioned person before the pronoun ""his.""
2. The action sequence makes more sense if Garca is the one taking the shot:
   - Xabi Alonso takes the corner (passes the ball)
   - The ball finds Garca (receives the ball)
   - Garca's (his) shot hits the woodwork

It's less likely that ""his"" refers to Xabi Alonso because Xabi Alonso's role in this sequence ended with taking the corner. The natural flow of the action suggests that Garca is the one who received the ball and took the shot.

Therefore, ""his"" most likely refers to Garca.",1,0
1730,"Eventually, Anna breaks up with Serena, because she believes that she has slept with someone else and she is tired of her holding secrets from her.",she,"0: Serena, 1: Anna, 2: Neither","In this sentence, there are multiple instances of 'she' and 'her', making it ambiguous which 'she' refers to which person. However, based on the context, we can deduce the following:

1. Anna breaks up with Serena
2. Someone believes that someone else has slept with another person
3. Someone is tired of someone holding secrets

Given that Anna is the one breaking up with Serena, it's more likely that Anna is the one who believes Serena has slept with someone else and is tired of Serena holding secrets. Therefore, the 'she' in question most likely refers to Anna.

The pronoun 'she' in this context is used to refer to the person doing the believing and being tired, which aligns with Anna's actions in breaking up with Serena.",1,1
1731,"Juanita attempted to shoot Theresa, but the gun exploded in her hand.",her,"0: Juanita, 1: Theresa, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""her"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence describes an action where Juanita is the subject (the one attempting to shoot).
2. Theresa is the object (the one being shot at).
3. The pronoun ""her"" is used in the phrase ""the gun exploded in her hand.""

Given this information, it's most logical that the gun would be in the hand of the person doing the shooting, which is Juanita. It wouldn't make sense for the gun to explode in Theresa's hand since she's not described as holding the gun.

Therefore, the pronoun ""her"" most likely refers to Juanita.",1,0
1732,"In a frantic attempt to save Daniel, Paul manages to resuscitate after he has been clinically dead for almost a half hour.",he,"0: Paul, 1: Daniel, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence describes Paul's action of resuscitating someone.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""after he has been clinically dead for almost a half hour.""
3. Logically, the person who was clinically dead and needed resuscitation would be Daniel, not Paul (who was performing the resuscitation).
4. Therefore, ""he"" in this context refers to Daniel, who was the one being saved and had been clinically dead.

Based on this analysis, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Daniel.",1,1
1733,"Vanessa is attracted to Marguerite, but she is in a relationship with Paul Chauvelin, an agent of Maximilien Robespierre.",she,"0: Vanessa, 1: Marguerite, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Vanessa is attracted to Marguerite""
2. Then it continues with ""but she is in a relationship with Paul Chauvelin""

The pronoun ""she"" is more likely to refer to Vanessa for the following reasons:
- Vanessa is the subject of the first clause and the main focus of the sentence.
- The conjunction ""but"" introduces a contrasting idea, which is more likely to be about the same person (Vanessa) rather than switching to Marguerite.
- It's more logical that the person who is attracted to someone else (Vanessa) would be the one in a relationship with a third person, as it creates a conflict or complication in the narrative.

Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Vanessa.",1,0
1734,"Amy initially does n't trust Olivia, but she soon wins her trust.",she,"0: Amy, 1: Olivia, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, let's analyze the sentence:

""Amy initially doesn't trust Olivia, but she soon wins her trust.""

In this sentence, ""she"" is the subject of the clause ""she soon wins her trust."" The pronoun ""she"" is performing the action of winning trust. 

Given the context, it makes more sense for Olivia to be the one winning Amy's trust, rather than Amy winning her own trust. This is because:

1. The sentence starts with Amy not trusting Olivia.
2. The use of ""but"" indicates a contrast or change in the initial situation.
3. It's more logical for Olivia to be the one who wins Amy's trust, changing the initial distrust.

Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Olivia (candidate 1).",1,1
1735,Gennie becomes interested in Emma and is jealous when she starts seeing Chas.,she,"0: Gennie, 1: Emma, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Gennie becomes interested in Emma"".
2. The second part of the sentence uses ""she"" in ""when she starts seeing Chas"".
3. Logically, if Gennie is interested in Emma, it's more likely that Emma is the one who starts seeing Chas, making Gennie jealous.
4. The pronoun ""she"" is used to avoid repeating Emma's name in the second part of the sentence.

Based on this analysis, it's most probable that ""she"" refers to Emma, not Gennie.",1,1
1736,"Andre tries to guilt Zach, but he reminds him that he is the one who is abandoning his son, not him.",he,"0: Andre, 1: Zach, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. ""Andre tries to guilt Zach"" - This establishes Andre as the subject and Zach as the object of the first clause.

2. ""but he reminds him"" - Here, we have two pronouns: ""he"" and ""him"". We need to determine which one refers to our target pronoun ""he"".

3. ""that he is the one who is abandoning his son, not him"" - This part provides crucial context for identifying the referent of ""he"".

The key to solving this is understanding that the person doing the reminding is pointing out that the other person is abandoning their son. Given that Andre is trying to guilt Zach, it's more likely that Zach is the one reminding Andre about abandoning his son.

Therefore, the ""he"" in ""he reminds him"" most likely refers to Zach. Zach is reminding Andre (him) that Andre (he) is the one abandoning his son, not Zach (him).",1,"1

The sentence structure indicates that Kirk is the subject of the first clause (""Kirk next tried to kill Eden""), and then in the second clause, Gina stopped ""him"". The ""him"" in this context logically refers back to Kirk, as he was the one attempting the action that Gina stopped. It wouldn't make sense for ""him"" to refer to Eden or anyone else in this context.",0,0
1738,Paul helped Lionel hide when he was pursued by the authorities.,he,"0: Paul, 1: Lionel, 2: Neither","To determine who the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence states that ""Paul helped Lionel hide.""
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""when he was pursued by the authorities.""
3. Logically, the person being pursued by the authorities is the one who needs to hide.
4. Since Paul is helping Lionel hide, it's more likely that Lionel is the one being pursued.
5. Therefore, ""he"" most likely refers to Lionel, as he is the one who needs to hide from the authorities.

Based on this reasoning, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Lionel.",1,1
1739,"Akos is physically strong enough to fight Doro, but there are times where he does not retaliate against his physical abuse.",he,"0: Akos, 1: Doro, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Akos for the following reasons:

1. Akos is mentioned first in the sentence, making him the primary subject.
2. The sentence is describing Akos' ability and behavior, stating that he is strong enough to fight Doro but sometimes chooses not to retaliate.
3. The phrase ""does not retaliate against his physical abuse"" implies that Akos is the one who could potentially retaliate against Doro's abuse, not the other way around.

Therefore, ""he"" in this context refers to Akos, who is the subject of the sentence and the one described as not retaliating.",1,0
1740,"Anna asks Samantha if she was abused as a child, and Samantha is offended.",she,"0: Anna, 1: Samantha, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Samantha for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure suggests that Anna is asking Samantha about someone's past, and it would be more logical for Anna to ask about Samantha's experiences rather than her own.

2. The fact that Samantha is offended by the question implies that the question was about her, not about Anna.

3. It's more natural in conversation to ask someone else about their experiences rather than talking about oneself in the third person.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" in this context most likely refers to Samantha.",1,1
1741,"Sharon complains and Whitney is suspended, but appeals for her job and is allowed to keep it.",her,"0: Sharon, 1: Whitney, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""her"" is most likely referring to Whitney. The context suggests that Whitney is the one who is suspended and then appeals for her job. The pronoun ""her"" is used in the phrase ""appeals for her job,"" which logically connects to Whitney's suspension. Sharon is mentioned as complaining, but there's no indication that she lost her job or needed to appeal for it. Therefore, ""her"" in this context refers to Whitney.",0,1
1742,"Jack and Mark get increasingly drunk and show up uninvited to see classmates, but they refuses to let them in.",they,"0: classmates, 1: Jack and Mark, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" is most likely referring to the classmates. The context suggests that Jack and Mark are the ones showing up uninvited, and ""they"" (the classmates) are refusing to let Jack and Mark in. This interpretation makes the most logical sense given the structure of the sentence and the actions described.

The pronoun ""they"" is used in the singular form (""refuses"") which grammatically doesn't match with ""Jack and Mark"" (which would require ""refuse""). While this could be a grammatical error, it's more likely that ""they"" is referring to a collective noun (classmates) treated as a singular entity.

Therefore, the pronoun ""they"" most likely refers to the classmates (option 0).",0,0
1743,"Doherty decided to appear after talking with Sophia, but her appearance was moved to the second episode.",her,"0: Doherty, 1: Sophia, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""her"" most likely refers to Doherty for the following reasons:

1. Doherty is the main subject of the sentence and the one performing the action (deciding to appear).
2. The pronoun ""her"" is used in relation to an ""appearance,"" which logically connects to Doherty's decision to appear.
3. Sophia is mentioned in a subordinate clause and is not the focus of the main action in the sentence.
4. It would make more sense for Doherty's appearance to be moved to the second episode, as she is the one who decided to appear after talking with Sophia.

Therefore, the pronoun ""her"" most likely refers to Doherty.",0,0
1744,"Danny refuses to be taught by the only local stone mage, Jebilu Stoneslicer, so Briar is stuck being his teacher.",his,"0: Danny, 1: the only local stone mage , Jebilu Stoneslicer, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""his"" is most likely referring to Danny. The context suggests that Danny is the one who needs a teacher, and Briar is described as ""being his teacher."" Since Danny is the subject of the first part of the sentence and the one refusing to be taught by Jebilu Stoneslicer, it makes sense that ""his"" refers to Danny, indicating that Briar is teaching Danny instead of Jebilu Stoneslicer.",0,0
1745,Ali was urged to accept Abu Musa but he never did.,he,"0: Ali, 1: Abu Musa, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Ali for the following reasons:

1. Ali is the subject of the sentence and the main focus of the action.
2. The sentence structure suggests that Ali is the one who ""never did"" accept something, which aligns with the pronoun ""he.""
3. Abu Musa is mentioned as the object of what Ali was urged to accept, not as the subject performing an action.

The sentence implies that Ali was the one who didn't accept something (in this case, Abu Musa), so ""he"" refers back to Ali.",0,0
1746,Raj looks forward to woo Max but he does n't take his calls.,he,"0: Raj, 1: Max, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Raj looks forward to woo Max,"" indicating that Raj is the active subject who wants to pursue Max.
2. The second part of the sentence, ""but he doesn't take his calls,"" provides additional information about one of the characters.
3. Given the context, it's more likely that Max is the one not taking calls, as Raj is trying to woo him.
4. If Raj were not taking his own calls, it would contradict his desire to woo Max.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Max, as he is the one not responding to Raj's attempts to contact him.",1,1
1747,"Jeremy grows cool to Kirk after this, believing he fled to avoid meeting his parents.",he,"0: Jeremy, 1: Kirk, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Jeremy is the subject of the sentence, and he is the one growing cool towards Kirk.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""believing he fled to avoid meeting his parents.""
3. It wouldn't make sense for Jeremy to flee to avoid meeting his own parents, as he is the one growing cool towards Kirk.
4. The logical interpretation is that Kirk is the one who fled to avoid meeting Jeremy's parents.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" in this context refers to Kirk.",1,1
1748,Ed Helms was cast as Derek Smeathe but scheduling conflicts prevented him from taking the role.,him,"0: Derek Smeathe, 1: Ed Helms, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""him"" refers to Ed Helms. The sentence structure indicates that Ed Helms was initially cast for the role of Derek Smeathe, but he (Ed Helms) couldn't take the role due to scheduling conflicts. The pronoun ""him"" is used to avoid repeating Ed Helms' name in the latter part of the sentence. It wouldn't make sense for ""him"" to refer to Derek Smeathe, as Derek Smeathe is the character role, not the actor facing scheduling conflicts.",1,1
1749,Melinda does not tell Zoe this because she wants her to have a normal life.,she,"0: Melinda, 1: Zoe, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Melinda is the subject of the sentence, performing the action of not telling.
2. Zoe is the object, the person not being told something.
3. The pronoun ""she"" appears in the clause ""she wants her to have a normal life.""

Given this structure, ""she"" most likely refers to Melinda because:
a) Melinda is the main actor in the sentence.
b) The desire to keep information from Zoe (for her to have a normal life) aligns with Melinda's action of not telling.
c) If ""she"" referred to Zoe, the sentence would be illogical, as Zoe wouldn't be withholding information from herself.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Melinda.",0,0
1750,"Annette clearly has a crush on Lea, but she does n't know.",she,"0: Annette, 1: Lea, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. The sentence structure suggests that ""she"" is referring to the person who doesn't know about the crush. Given the context, it's more likely that Lea is unaware of Annette's crush on her, rather than Annette being unaware of her own feelings. Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Lea.",1,1
1751,Two young boys are sent to live with relatives when their parents break up.,their,"0: relatives, 1: Two young boys, 2: Neither","The pronoun ""their"" in this sentence refers to ""Two young boys"" for the following reasons:

1. The sentence is about the boys being sent to live with relatives.
2. ""Their parents"" logically refers to the parents of the two young boys.
3. The possessive pronoun ""their"" is used to show ownership or association, which in this case is the relationship between the boys and their parents.
4. ""Relatives"" are mentioned as a separate entity, so ""their"" cannot refer to them.
5. The structure of the sentence places ""Two young boys"" as the subject, making it the most likely antecedent for the pronoun ""their"".

Therefore, the pronoun ""their"" clearly refers to ""Two young boys"".",1,1
1752,James comes to the aid of Brian when he finds a dog stuck in a peat bog.,he,"0: James, 1: Brian, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""James comes to the aid of Brian.""
2. This is followed by ""when he finds a dog stuck in a peat bog.""

The pronoun ""he"" is more likely to refer to James for the following reasons:
1. James is the subject of the main clause and is performing the action of coming to Brian's aid.
2. The ""when"" clause describes the circumstances under which James is helping Brian.
3. It's more logical that James finds the dog and then comes to Brian's aid, rather than Brian finding the dog and James coming to his aid.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to James.",1,0
1753,"The tiger was attacking zebra initially alone, but later he was assisted by his sub-adult cub.",he,"0: zebra, 1: The tiger, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to the tiger for several reasons:

1. The tiger is the main subject of the sentence and is mentioned first.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the context of being ""assisted by his sub-adult cub,"" which logically refers to the tiger, as tigers are known to hunt in family groups.
3. Zebras are typically referred to as ""it"" rather than ""he"" unless specifically identified as male.
4. The action of ""attacking"" is associated with the tiger, and the later action of being ""assisted"" is a continuation of the tiger's actions.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to the tiger.",1,1
1754,Ronald understands why Pradeep is so aggressive and he offers him considerable support.,him,"0: Ronald, 1: Pradeep, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""him"" refers to Pradeep for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure indicates that Ronald is the subject performing the action of offering support.
2. ""him"" is the object receiving the support.
3. Pradeep is mentioned as the person who is aggressive, and it makes logical sense that Ronald would offer support to the person who is being aggressive.
4. It wouldn't make sense for Ronald to offer support to himself in this context.

Therefore, ""him"" refers to Pradeep, which corresponds to candidate 1.",1,1
1755,"Tom arrives to where Ali was tied, but he has come free of his lead.",he,"0: Tom, 1: Ali, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Ali for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure suggests a contrast between Tom's arrival and Ali's state.
2. The phrase ""but he has come free of his lead"" implies a change in condition, which is more likely to apply to Ali, who was previously tied.
3. It would be redundant and less coherent to say that Tom has come free of his lead right after mentioning his arrival.
4. The use of ""his lead"" further supports that this refers to Ali, as it's more likely that Ali (who was tied) had a lead, rather than Tom who just arrived.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" in this context most likely refers to Ali.",1,1
1756,"Kai was to be voiced by Mads Mikkelsen, but he dropped out due to scheduling issues and the role was recast to J.K. Simmons.",he,"0: Mads Mikkelsen, 1: Kai, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Mads Mikkelsen. The context indicates that Mads Mikkelsen was initially cast to voice the character Kai, but then dropped out of the project. The pronoun ""he"" is used to refer back to Mads Mikkelsen when explaining his departure from the role due to scheduling issues. Therefore, the correct referent for the pronoun ""he"" is Mads Mikkelsen, which corresponds to candidate 0.",0,0
1757,Then Barako Bull coach Yeng Guiao wanted Juntilla to be waived because of his sudden absence just after signing a two-year contract with the team.,his,"0: Juntilla, 1: Barako Bull coach Yeng Guiao, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""his"" refers to Juntilla. The context indicates that Juntilla had signed a two-year contract with the team, and then had a ""sudden absence."" This absence is what prompted Coach Yeng Guiao to want Juntilla to be waived. The possessive pronoun ""his"" is directly referring to Juntilla's absence, not to anything related to Coach Yeng Guiao.",1,0
1758,Dimmitt welcomed Viesca but refused to recognize his authority as governor.,his,"0: Dimmitt, 1: Viesca, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""his"" refers to Viesca. The context indicates that Dimmitt welcomed Viesca but refused to recognize Viesca's authority as governor. The pronoun ""his"" is used to refer back to Viesca's authority, not Dimmitt's. This makes sense because Viesca is the one being described as having authority (as governor) that Dimmitt refuses to recognize.",0,1
1759,"Jeoffrey argues with Ethan because of his lying, and asks what happened to the Ethan that he met two years ago.",his,"0: Jeoffrey, 1: Ethan, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""his"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence mentions two people: Jeoffrey and Ethan.
2. The pronoun ""his"" is used in the phrase ""his lying.""
3. The sentence states that Jeoffrey argues with Ethan because of ""his lying.""
4. It's more logical that Jeoffrey would argue with Ethan because of Ethan's lying, rather than Jeoffrey's own lying.
5. The question ""what happened to the Ethan that he met two years ago"" further supports that Ethan's behavior (lying) is the issue.

Based on this analysis, it's clear that ""his"" refers to Ethan's lying, not Jeoffrey's.",1,1
1760,Once David realises that Kabir is probably frustrated but not a bad human being he gets a little comfortable with him.,he,"0: David, 1: Kabir, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to David. The sentence structure indicates that David is the subject who realizes something about Kabir and then becomes more comfortable. The pronoun ""he"" is used to avoid repeating David's name in the second part of the sentence. It's clear that David is the one getting comfortable with Kabir, not the other way around.",0,0
1761,Elena is frightened as Annie suddenly appears as if she wants to eat her as well.,she,"0: Elena, 1: Annie, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which person the pronoun ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Elena is described as being frightened.
2. Annie is described as suddenly appearing.
3. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the phrase ""as if she wants to eat her as well.""

Given this information, it's more logical that ""she"" refers to Annie, not Elena. The sentence is describing Annie's actions and how they are perceived by Elena. It wouldn't make sense for Elena to want to eat herself. Therefore, ""she"" in this context is most likely referring to Annie.",1,1
1762,Phoebe asked Diane to choose but she could n't and fled to Brighton.,she,"0: Phoebe, 1: Diane, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, let's analyze the sentence:

""Phoebe asked Diane to choose but she couldn't and fled to Brighton.""

The pronoun ""she"" is used in the context of someone who ""couldn't"" (choose) and ""fled to Brighton."" This action is more likely to be associated with Diane for the following reasons:

1. Phoebe is the one who asked Diane to choose, putting Diane in the position of making a decision.
2. The sentence structure suggests that ""she"" refers to the person who was asked to choose (Diane) rather than the person doing the asking (Phoebe).
3. The act of fleeing to Brighton implies that the person was unable to handle the pressure of making a choice, which aligns more with Diane's position in this scenario.

Therefore, based on the context and sentence structure, it is more logical to conclude that ""she"" refers to Diane.",1,1
1763,Justice Lise Maisonneuve ruled that Anna should be deported when her sentence was complete.,her,"0: Anna, 1: Justice Lise Maisonneuve, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""her"" refers to Anna. The context indicates that Anna is the subject of the deportation ruling, and ""her sentence"" implies that Anna is the one serving a sentence. Justice Lise Maisonneuve is the one making the ruling, not the one being deported or serving a sentence.",0,0
1764,Andrea noted that Genie became extremely upset if someone touched or moved anything she had collected.,she,"0: Andrea, 1: Genie, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence is about Andrea noting something about Genie.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the phrase ""she had collected.""
3. The sentence describes Genie becoming upset if someone touched or moved her collected items.

Based on this analysis, it's clear that the pronoun ""she"" refers to Genie, not Andrea. The sentence is describing Genie's behavior and her possessions (the things she had collected). Andrea is merely the observer in this context, not the subject of the pronoun.",1,1
1765,Bela then threw Yvonne out after she said Rita was better off being dead or being left in a home.,she,"0: Bela, 1: Yvonne, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Bela then threw Yvonne out...""
2. This is followed by ""after she said...""
3. The pronoun ""she"" is used to refer to the person who said something about Rita.

Given this structure, it's more likely that ""she"" refers to Yvonne rather than Bela. The sentence implies that Bela threw Yvonne out as a result of what Yvonne said. It wouldn't make sense for Bela to throw Yvonne out because of something Bela herself said.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Yvonne (candidate 1).",1,1
1766,"Apokaukos also tried to kidnap the young John V, but failed and was forced to flee to his house at Epibatai.",his,"0: Apokaukos, 1: the young John V, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""his"" is most likely referring to Apokaukos for the following reasons:

1. Apokaukos is the main subject of the sentence and the one performing the actions (trying to kidnap and fleeing).
2. The phrase ""his house at Epibatai"" suggests ownership of a house, which is more likely to belong to an adult (Apokaukos) rather than a young person (John V).
3. The sentence structure indicates that after the failed kidnapping attempt, the subject (Apokaukos) was forced to flee to a specific location, which is described as ""his house.""

Therefore, the pronoun ""his"" most likely refers to Apokaukos.",1,0
1767,Narendran wants to get Ramu married to Leela but she is turned off by his cowardice.,his,"0: Narendran, 1: Ramu, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. Narendran wants to get Ramu married to Leela.
2. ""but she is turned off by his cowardice.""

The pronoun ""his"" in this context is most likely referring to Ramu for the following reasons:

1. The sentence is about Ramu getting married to Leela.
2. It's more logical that Leela would be turned off by Ramu's cowardice, as he is the potential marriage partner.
3. Narendran is not directly involved in the marriage; he's just trying to arrange it.
4. It wouldn't make sense for Leela to be turned off by Narendran's cowardice in this context.

Therefore, the pronoun ""his"" most likely refers to Ramu.",1,1
1768,"Josse manage to find Gauthier, but he's in very bad shape.",he,"0: Josse, 1: Gauthier, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Gauthier for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure suggests that Josse is the subject who found Gauthier.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the second part of the sentence, which is describing someone's condition.
3. It would be more logical for the person who was found (Gauthier) to be in bad shape, rather than the person doing the finding (Josse).
4. If ""he"" referred to Josse, the sentence would be somewhat confusing and poorly constructed.

Therefore, based on context and logical flow, ""he"" most likely refers to Gauthier.",1,1
1769,"Lastly, Rahul is killed by Nikhil when he shoots him with a gun.",he,"0: Nikhil, 1: Rahul, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence states that ""Rahul is killed by Nikhil.""
2. This is followed by ""when he shoots him with a gun.""
3. The pronoun ""he"" in this context refers to the person doing the shooting.
4. Since Nikhil is the one who kills Rahul, it logically follows that Nikhil is the one doing the shooting.
5. Therefore, ""he"" in this sentence refers to Nikhil.

The pronoun ""he"" clearly refers to Nikhil (candidate 0) in this context.",0,0
1770,"Arthur has trailed Lopaka, but he gets the jump on them.",he,"0: Lopaka, 1: Arthur, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Arthur has trailed Lopaka: This indicates that Arthur was following Lopaka.
2. ""he gets the jump on them"": This phrase suggests that someone surprises or gains an advantage over the other person.

Given this information, it's more logical that ""he"" refers to Arthur for the following reasons:
- Arthur was initially trailing Lopaka, implying he was behind.
- The phrase ""gets the jump on them"" indicates a reversal of the situation, where the follower (Arthur) now has an advantage over the person being followed (Lopaka).
- The pronoun ""them"" likely refers to Lopaka, further supporting that ""he"" is Arthur.

Therefore, ""he"" most likely refers to Arthur in this context.",1,1
1771,"Paul believes that Daniel is innocent, so he decides to try to figure out what really happened.",he,"0: Paul, 1: Daniel, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Paul for the following reasons:

1. Paul is the subject of the main clause and is mentioned first, making him the more prominent character in the sentence.

2. The sentence structure suggests that Paul is the one taking action. The phrase ""so he decides"" indicates that the subject of the first part of the sentence (Paul) is the one making the decision.

3. The action of ""trying to figure out what really happened"" aligns more logically with Paul's belief that Daniel is innocent. It makes sense that Paul, who holds this belief, would be the one to investigate further.

4. If ""he"" referred to Daniel, the sentence would be somewhat illogical, as it would imply that Daniel is trying to figure out what happened regarding his own innocence, which is less likely in this context.

Therefore, based on the sentence structure and logical flow, ""he"" most likely refers to Paul.",0,0
1772,"Anna tries to apologise to Colleen, but she refuses to accept it.",she,"0: Anna, 1: Colleen, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" refers to Colleen. The context indicates that Anna is trying to apologize, but someone is refusing to accept the apology. Logically, the person refusing to accept the apology would be Colleen, not Anna (who is doing the apologizing). Therefore, ""she"" in this case refers to Colleen, who is refusing to accept Anna's apology.",1,1
1773,"Emma tries to reconcile with Meche but she rejects her, as she prefers Javier.",she,"0: Emma, 1: Meche, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""she"" the pronoun refers to. There are two instances of ""she"" in the sentence, and we need to analyze them separately:

1. First ""she"": ""...but she rejects her...""
   This ""she"" is clearly referring to Meche, as Meche is the one rejecting Emma's reconciliation attempt.

2. Second ""she"": ""...as she prefers Javier.""
   This ""she"" is also referring to Meche, as it's continuing to describe Meche's actions and preferences.

Both instances of ""she"" in this sentence refer to Meche, not Emma. Therefore, the correct answer is 1, which corresponds to Meche in the candidate list.",1,1
1774,"Christina states Elga is not able to pose, but all the others find her shot captivating and interesting.",her,"0: Christina, 1: Elga, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. Christina states that Elga is not able to pose.
2. ""But all the others find her shot captivating and interesting.""

The pronoun ""her"" in this context refers to the person whose shot is being discussed. Since Christina is making a statement about Elga's ability to pose, it's logical to assume that the ""shot"" being referred to is Elga's.

The phrase ""all the others"" implies that there are multiple people involved in this scenario, and they have an opinion that contrasts with Christina's. This further supports the idea that they are discussing Elga's shot, not Christina's.

Therefore, ""her"" in this sentence most likely refers to Elga.",1,1
1775,"Doherty decided to appear after talking with Noemie, but her appearance was moved to the second episode.",her,"0: Doherty, 1: Noemie, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""her"" most likely refers to Doherty for the following reasons:

1. Doherty is the subject of the main clause and the primary focus of the sentence.
2. The sentence structure suggests that ""her appearance"" is directly related to Doherty's decision to appear.
3. While Noemie is mentioned, she is part of a subordinate clause describing the circumstances of Doherty's decision.
4. It's more logical that the appearance being discussed is Doherty's, as the sentence is about Doherty's actions and decisions.

Therefore, ""her"" in this context refers to Doherty, not Noemie.",0,0
1776,"Daniela likes Annie because, contrarily to Naomi, she listens to what she has to say.",she,"0: Daniela, 1: Annie, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. The pronoun ""she"" appears twice in the sentence: ""she listens to what she has to say.""
2. The first ""she"" is the subject of ""listens,"" and we need to determine who this refers to.
3. The sentence structure suggests that this ""she"" is being contrasted with Naomi.
4. The sentence begins with ""Daniela likes Annie because,"" indicating that the following information is about Annie, not Daniela.
5. Therefore, the ""she"" who listens is most likely Annie, as this quality is being presented as the reason Daniela likes her.

Given this analysis, the pronoun ""she"" (the first one in the sentence) refers to Annie.",1,1
1777,"Neda goes to talk to Stella, but instead finds a card saying she has run away with Tony.",she,"0: Neda, 1: Stella, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Stella. The context suggests that Neda goes to talk to Stella but finds a card instead. The card indicates that ""she"" (the person Neda was looking for) has run away with Tony. Since Neda is the one doing the action of going to talk to someone, it wouldn't make sense for ""she"" to refer to Neda. Therefore, ""she"" must refer to Stella, who has left the card and run away with Tony.",1,1
1778,"Director Ulli Lommel was unsure about casting Klaus Kinski, but he met him and he was very nice, according to Lommel.",he,"0: Director Ulli Lommel, 1: Klaus Kinski, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""he"" the pronoun refers to. There are two instances of ""he"" in the sentence:

1. ""he met him""
2. ""he was very nice""

Let's analyze each:

1. ""he met him"" - In this case, ""he"" likely refers to Director Ulli Lommel, as he is the subject of the sentence and the one who was unsure about casting Klaus Kinski. It makes sense that Lommel would be the one meeting Kinski.

2. ""he was very nice"" - This ""he"" refers to Klaus Kinski. The sentence structure suggests that Lommel's opinion of Kinski changed after meeting him, finding him to be ""very nice.""

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" in the question most likely refers to Klaus Kinski, as the statement about being ""very nice"" is the main point of the sentence and the most recent reference.",0,1
1779,"The defending commander, Shi Kefa, was also executed by Qing after he refused to submit to his authority.",he,"0: The defending commander , Shi Kefa, 1: Qing, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Shi Kefa, the defending commander. This can be determined from the context:

1. Shi Kefa is introduced first as ""The defending commander.""
2. The sentence states that ""he refused to submit to his authority,"" which implies that Shi Kefa was the one who refused to submit to Qing's authority.
3. The execution of Shi Kefa by Qing is a consequence of this refusal, further confirming that ""he"" refers to Shi Kefa.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" clearly refers to the first candidate, Shi Kefa, and not to Qing or any other entity not mentioned in the candidates.",0,0
1780,"Julia returns to see how Anna is, where she tells her that Phelan tried to rape her.",she,"0: Julia, 1: Anna, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Julia returns to see how Anna is doing.
2. ""She"" tells ""her"" that Phelan tried to rape her.

The pronoun ""she"" is more likely to refer to Anna in this context because:

1. Julia is the one returning, implying she's the one checking on Anna.
2. It would make more sense for Anna to be telling Julia about the attempted rape, as Anna is the one being checked on and likely the victim in this situation.
3. The sentence structure suggests that ""she"" (Anna) is telling ""her"" (Julia) about the incident.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Anna.",1,1
1781,"Theresa almost admits to killing Stephanie, but stops when Logan tells her he is a police officer.",her,"0: Theresa, 1: Stephanie, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which person the pronoun ""her"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Theresa almost admits to killing Stephanie.""
2. The second part of the sentence says, ""but stops when Logan tells her he is a police officer.""

The pronoun ""her"" in this context is most likely referring to Theresa for the following reasons:
1. Theresa is the subject of the sentence and the main actor in the described situation.
2. The pronoun ""her"" is used in the context of someone (Logan) telling information to this person.
3. It makes logical sense that Theresa would stop admitting to a crime when she learns that Logan is a police officer.

Stephanie, on the other hand, is mentioned as the victim of the killing and is not an active participant in the described interaction with Logan.

Therefore, the pronoun ""her"" most likely refers to Theresa.",0,0
1782,"Theresa wakes up and attempts to escape Sandra, but she holds her captive.",she,"0: Theresa, 1: Sandra, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Theresa is mentioned first, waking up and attempting to escape.
2. Sandra is mentioned second.
3. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""she holds her captive.""

Given this information, it's more likely that ""she"" refers to Sandra because:
1. Sandra is the last mentioned person before the pronoun ""she"" is used.
2. The action of holding someone captive aligns more logically with Sandra, as Theresa was trying to escape.
3. If ""she"" referred to Theresa, the sentence would not make sense, as Theresa wouldn't be trying to escape and hold herself captive at the same time.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Sandra.",1,1
1783,Branislav Lei was intentionally chosen to play the role of Teodor Teja Kraj because he actively participated in overthrowing the Miloevi's regime.,he,"0: Teodor Teja Kraj, 1: Branislav Lei, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence is about Branislav Lei being chosen for a role.
2. The pronoun ""he"" appears in the clause ""because he actively participated in overthrowing the Miloevi's regime.""
3. This clause provides a reason for Branislav Lei being chosen for the role.
4. It's more logical that the reason for choosing an actor would be related to the actor's actions, not the character's actions.
5. Therefore, ""he"" most likely refers to Branislav Lei, as it's describing his past actions that led to him being chosen for the role.

Based on this analysis, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Branislav Lei.",0,1
1784,"Dolly has grown fond of Marie, but can not hide her disappointment from her.",her,"0: Dolly, 1: Marie, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""her"" the pronoun refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Dolly has grown fond of Marie.""
2. The second part of the sentence says ""but can not hide her disappointment from her.""

The first ""her"" in ""her disappointment"" likely refers to Dolly, as she is the subject of the sentence and the one experiencing the emotion (disappointment).

The second ""her"" in ""from her"" is more likely to refer to Marie. This is because:
1. It wouldn't make sense for Dolly to hide her disappointment from herself.
2. The sentence structure suggests that Dolly is hiding her feelings from someone else, which in this context is Marie.

Since we are asked about the pronoun ""her"" without specifying which one, and the question is about a single pronoun, we should consider the last occurrence of ""her"" in the sentence. This last ""her"" refers to Marie.",0,1
1785,"The Englishman manages to evade the guard, but then deliberately does not carry out his assignment.",his,"0: the guard, 1: The Englishman, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""his"" refers to ""The Englishman"" for the following reasons:

1. ""The Englishman"" is the subject of the sentence and the main actor in the described events.
2. The pronoun ""his"" is used in relation to an ""assignment,"" which is more likely to belong to the main character (The Englishman) rather than the guard.
3. The sentence structure suggests that ""The Englishman"" is the one who ""does not carry out his assignment,"" indicating that the assignment belongs to him.
4. It would not make sense for ""his"" to refer to the guard in this context, as the guard is not the one with an assignment to carry out.

Therefore, the pronoun ""his"" clearly refers to ""The Englishman"" (candidate 1).",1,1
1786,The rustler kidnap Sundowner but he uses telepathy to get Dancer to come to his rescue.,he,"0: Sundowner, 1: The rustler, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Sundowner for the following reasons:

1. Sentence structure: The pronoun ""he"" appears immediately after ""Sundowner"" is mentioned, making it the most recent and logical antecedent.

2. Subject of the action: The sentence describes ""he"" as using telepathy to get Dancer to come to the rescue. This action is more likely to be performed by the kidnapped person (Sundowner) rather than the kidnapper (the rustler).

3. Context: It makes more sense for the kidnapped person to call for help rather than the kidnapper.

4. Grammatical agreement: ""He"" is singular and masculine, which agrees with ""Sundowner"" (typically a masculine name).

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Sundowner, which is candidate 0.",0,0
1787,"Danny is pursued by Bob's sailor son Billy, but he longs to escape the suburbs and lead a more glamorous life elsewhere.",he,"0: Danny, 1: Bob 's sailor son Billy, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence introduces two main characters: Danny and Billy (Bob's sailor son).
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""but he longs to escape the suburbs and lead a more glamorous life elsewhere.""
3. This clause is describing someone's desire to escape and lead a different life.
4. Given the sentence structure, it's more likely that this desire is attributed to Danny, who is the subject of the first part of the sentence.
5. Billy is mentioned as pursuing Danny, which suggests that Billy is not the one trying to escape.

Based on this analysis, it's most logical that ""he"" refers to Danny, as he is the main subject of the sentence and the one who seems to be in a situation he wants to escape from.",0,0
1788,"Lemieux got up, but Rubio continued where he left off and threw more punches at him.",he,"0: Lemieux, 1: Rubio, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Rubio. The context indicates that after Lemieux got up, Rubio continued his actions from before and threw more punches. The phrase ""continued where he left off"" implies that Rubio was the one throwing punches previously and is now continuing that action. Therefore, ""he"" in this context refers to Rubio, not Lemieux.",1,1
1789,Warren snuck Nige outside and said that if he ever saw him again he would kill him.,he,"0: Warren, 1: Nige, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""he"" the pronoun refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Warren is the subject of the sentence and the one performing the actions (sneaking Nige outside and saying something).
2. The pronoun ""he"" appears twice in the latter part of the sentence: ""if he ever saw him again he would kill him.""
3. The first ""he"" is likely referring to Warren, as he is the one making the statement.
4. The ""him"" in both instances refers to Nige, as Warren is talking about seeing and potentially killing Nige.

Given this analysis, the pronoun ""he"" in question most likely refers to Warren. Warren is the one who would see Nige again and who would kill Nige. It wouldn't make sense for Nige to be the one seeing himself or killing himself in this context.",0,0
1790,"Phoebe tries to help Rachel but she pushes her away, it soon becomes clear she is suffering from Post natal depression.",she,"0: Phoebe, 1: Rachel, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""she"" the pronoun refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. The first ""she"" in ""she pushes her away"" likely refers to Rachel. This is because the sentence starts with ""Phoebe tries to help Rachel,"" and then describes Rachel's reaction to that help.

2. The second ""she"" in ""it soon becomes clear she is suffering from Post natal depression"" also refers to Rachel. Post natal depression (also known as postpartum depression) is a condition that affects mothers after giving birth, which fits with Rachel's character in the context of the Friends TV show.

Both instances of ""she"" in this sentence refer to Rachel, not Phoebe. The pronoun is used to avoid repeating Rachel's name and to maintain flow in the sentence.",1,1
1791,"Brooke is shot by hitman Don Lennox, after he mistakes her for Justine and she survives the attack.",he,"0: Brooke, 1: hitman Don Lennox, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" clearly refers to ""hitman Don Lennox"" for the following reasons:

1. Gender agreement: ""he"" is a masculine pronoun, which matches with ""Don Lennox"" (a typically male name).
2. Logical flow: The sentence describes Don Lennox's action of mistaking Brooke for Justine and shooting her. The pronoun ""he"" is used in reference to the person making the mistake, which is Don Lennox.
3. Subject-verb agreement: The verb ""mistakes"" agrees with a singular subject, which is ""he"" referring back to Don Lennox.
4. Context: The sentence is describing the actions of the hitman, not Brooke, so it makes sense for the pronoun to refer to Don Lennox.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" refers to candidate 1, hitman Don Lennox.",0,1
1792,Fernando goes to talk to Alfonso but he pretends not to recognise them and calls them liars.,he,"0: Fernando, 1: Alfonso, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Fernando goes to talk to Alfonso
2. ""he"" pretends not to recognize ""them""
3. ""he"" calls ""them"" liars

The pronoun ""he"" is more likely to refer to Alfonso because:
- Fernando is the one initiating the action (going to talk to Alfonso)
- The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" is responding to Fernando's action
- It would make more sense for Alfonso to pretend not to recognize Fernando (referred to as ""them"") and call them liars, rather than Fernando pretending not to recognize himself

Therefore, ""he"" most likely refers to Alfonso in this context.",1,1
1793,"Roth apparently kills Jenine, but Neph secretly preserves her for the godking, who is on his way.",her,"0: Roth, 1: Jenine, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""her"" clearly refers to Jenine. The context indicates that Roth seemingly kills Jenine, but Neph secretly preserves ""her"" (Jenine) for the godking. It wouldn't make sense for ""her"" to refer to Roth, as Roth is the one doing the apparent killing. The pronoun ""her"" is used to avoid repeating Jenine's name in the second part of the sentence.",1,1
1794,"Jeanne is frustrated with Leanne because she makes her pretend they are not together and punches her in the face, humiliating him in public.",she,"0: Jeanne, 1: Leanne, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the phrase ""she makes her pretend they are not together"".
2. This action of making someone pretend they are not together is more likely to be done by Leanne to Jeanne, given the context that Jeanne is frustrated with Leanne.
3. The pronoun ""she"" is also used in ""punches her in the face"". This violent action is consistent with the frustration mentioned earlier, suggesting that Leanne is the one performing these actions that are causing Jeanne's frustration.
4. The final part ""humiliating him in public"" is confusing as it introduces a male pronoun ""him"" which doesn't match either Jeanne or Leanne. This might be a typo or error in the text.

Based on this analysis, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Leanne, as she is the one causing Jeanne's frustration through her actions.",1,1
1795,"Laura grew concerned with Susan when she noticed she was frequently covered in bruises, and befriended her.",she,"0: Laura, 1: Susan, 2: Neither","In this sentence, there are two instances of the pronoun ""she"". Let's analyze them separately:

1. First ""she"": ""...when she noticed...""
   This ""she"" refers to Laura. Laura is the subject of the sentence and the one who grew concerned, so it makes sense that she is the one who noticed something about Susan.

2. Second ""she"": ""...she was frequently covered in bruises...""
   This ""she"" refers to Susan. Laura noticed something about Susan, specifically that Susan was frequently covered in bruises.

The question asks about which candidate the pronoun refers to, without specifying which instance of ""she"" we should consider. Since there are two instances referring to different people, we cannot give a single answer that applies to both. Therefore, the most appropriate response is to choose ""Neither"" as the label, since neither Laura nor Susan exclusively is the referent for all instances of ""she"" in the sentence.",0,2
1796,"Deb searches out Kajol, but she gets stabbed to death by Binod.",she,"0: Deb, 1: Kajol, 2: Neither","In the given sentence, the pronoun 'she' most likely refers to Kajol. The sentence structure suggests that Deb is searching for Kajol, and then 'she' (referring to the person being searched for, which is Kajol) gets stabbed by Binod. It's more logical that the person being searched (Kajol) is the one who ends up being stabbed, rather than the person doing the searching (Deb).",0,1
1797,"Irfane is now suspicious about Aadhavan but when he questions him in secret, he informs him that he is really Subramaniam's long lost runaway son Madhavan.",he,"0: Irfane, 1: Aadhavan, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. ""Irfane is now suspicious about Aadhavan"" - This sets up the context.
2. ""but when he questions him in secret"" - Here, ""he"" refers to Irfane, as he is the one who is suspicious and would logically be the one questioning.
3. ""he informs him that he is really Subramaniam's long lost runaway son Madhavan"" - In this part, ""he"" refers to Aadhavan, as he is the one providing information about his true identity.

The pronoun ""he"" appears multiple times in the sentence, but the question asks specifically about the first instance. In the first instance, ""he"" refers to Irfane, as he is the one questioning Aadhavan.",0,0
1798,"The soldiers of Edom did not attack the Israelites, though they prepared to resist aggression.",they,"0: the Israelites, 1: The soldiers of Edom, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, let's analyze the sentence:

""The soldiers of Edom did not attack the Israelites, though they prepared to resist aggression.""

The pronoun ""they"" is used in the second part of the sentence, which states ""though they prepared to resist aggression."" This action of preparing to resist aggression logically refers to the soldiers of Edom for the following reasons:

1. The soldiers of Edom are the main subject of the sentence.
2. The act of preparing to resist aggression aligns with the behavior of soldiers, who are typically responsible for defense.
3. It wouldn't make sense for the Israelites to prepare to resist aggression in this context, as they are presented as the potential recipients of an attack, not the defenders.

Therefore, ""they"" most likely refers to ""The soldiers of Edom"" (candidate 1).",1,1
1799,"Cassandra arranges a date with Annie, but she is furious when she stands her up.",she,"0: Cassandra, 1: Annie, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""she"" the pronoun refers to. There are two instances of ""she"" in the sentence, and we need to analyze the context to determine which one refers to which person.

The first ""she"" in ""she is furious"" likely refers to Cassandra for the following reasons:
1. Cassandra is mentioned first in the sentence, making her the primary subject.
2. The action of being ""furious"" is a reaction to being stood up, which implies that Cassandra is the one who was waiting for Annie.

The second ""she"" in ""she stands her up"" refers to Annie because:
1. Annie is the one who didn't show up for the date, as indicated by the phrase ""stands her up.""
2. This action is the cause of the fury mentioned earlier.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" in the question most likely refers to Cassandra, as she is the one who would be furious about being stood up.",0,0
1800,Mary becomes infatuated with Emma and is crushed when she does not return her affection.,she,"0: Mary, 1: Emma, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Mary becomes infatuated with Emma.
2. Mary is crushed when ""she"" does not return her affection.

The pronoun ""she"" is used in the context of not returning affection. Since Mary is the one who is infatuated and crushed, it logically follows that ""she"" refers to Emma, who is not returning Mary's affection.

The sentence structure implies that Mary is the subject experiencing the emotions (infatuation and being crushed), while Emma is the object of Mary's affection who does not reciprocate. Therefore, ""she"" in this context refers to Emma.",1,1
1801,Dom tries to stop Hector but he accidentally pushes Rubi off the edge of the building.,he,"0: Dom, 1: Hector, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Dom tries to stop Hector.""
2. The pronoun ""he"" appears after this initial clause.
3. The action associated with ""he"" is ""accidentally pushes Rubi off the edge of the building.""

Given this information, we can deduce that:
- Dom is trying to stop Hector, which implies Dom is taking action.
- The pronoun ""he"" is then used to describe the next action (pushing Rubi).
- It's more likely that the person trying to stop someone (Dom) would accidentally push someone else in the process, rather than the person being stopped (Hector).

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Dom.",1,0
1802,Alyssa is the obsessive stalker of Leatitia so she sends Betchay to spy on her at her flower farm.,she,"0: Alyssa, 1: Leatitia, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Alyssa is the obsessive stalker of Leatitia""
2. This is followed by ""so she sends Betchay to spy on her""

The pronoun ""she"" in this context is most likely referring to Alyssa for the following reasons:
1. Alyssa is the subject of the first clause and the main actor in the sentence.
2. The action of sending someone to spy aligns with the description of Alyssa as an ""obsessive stalker.""
3. The sentence structure suggests that ""she"" is continuing the action initiated by Alyssa.
4. The later use of ""her"" likely refers to Leatitia, as she is the one being spied on at her flower farm.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Alyssa.",0,0
1803,McGirt had warned Malignaggi that if he did n't do better in the next round he would pull him out and he stuck to his word.,he,"0: McGirt, 1: Malignaggi, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""he"" refers to. There are two instances of ""he"" in the sentence, and we need to analyze the context to identify the correct referent.

The first ""he"" in ""he would pull him out"" refers to McGirt. This is evident because McGirt is the one who had warned Malignaggi and is in a position to make decisions about pulling someone out (likely referring to pulling Malignaggi out of a boxing match).

The second ""he"" in ""he stuck to his word"" also refers to McGirt. This is a continuation of the previous action, indicating that McGirt followed through on his warning.

Both instances of ""he"" refer to McGirt, so the pronoun ""he"" in this context refers to McGirt.",0,0
1804,"Most Mexicans consider Cassez and her brother to be guilty, since they were indicted on the charges brought against them and freed on technical grounds.",they,"0: Cassez and her brother, 1: Most Mexicans, 2: Neither","The pronoun ""they"" in this context refers to Cassez and her brother for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure indicates that ""they"" is the subject of the passive voice construction ""were indicted"" and ""freed.""

2. The context of the sentence is discussing the guilt and legal situation of Cassez and her brother, not the opinions of Most Mexicans.

3. It would not make sense for ""Most Mexicans"" to be indicted on charges or freed on technical grounds in this context.

4. The pronoun ""they"" is used to refer back to the previously mentioned individuals, Cassez and her brother, who are the main subjects of the sentence.

Therefore, the pronoun ""they"" clearly refers to Cassez and her brother, which is candidate 0.",0,0
1805,"Matt then intends to kill Alena so Danko can feel what he lost, but he is unable to and surrenders.",he,"0: Matt, 1: Danko, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Matt. The context suggests that Matt is the subject of the action - he intends to kill Alena but is unable to and surrenders. The pronoun ""he"" is used to continue referring to Matt in the second part of the sentence. Danko is mentioned as a secondary character to explain Matt's motivation, but is not the main subject of the action described.",0,0
1806,Inspector Duffy is assigned to capture Sha but she's puzzled as to why she feels a strange connection to the killer.,she,"0: Sha, 1: Inspector Duffy, 2: Neither","In this sentence, there are two instances of the pronoun ""she"". Let's analyze them separately:

1. ""...but she's puzzled..."" - This ""she"" clearly refers to Inspector Duffy. It's describing Inspector Duffy's emotional state (being puzzled) in response to the assignment.

2. ""...why she feels..."" - This ""she"" also refers to Inspector Duffy. It's continuing to describe Inspector Duffy's internal experience (feeling a strange connection).

Both instances of ""she"" in this sentence refer to Inspector Duffy, not Sha. The sentence is describing Inspector Duffy's thoughts and feelings about the assignment to capture Sha. Sha is only mentioned as the target of the assignment and is not the subject of the pronouns.",0,1
1807,Tom has been working out and wants to have sex with Akos but he is not into it.,he,"0: Tom, 1: Akos, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""he"" refers to. The pronoun ""he"" is used after mentioning both Tom and Akos, so we need to analyze the context to determine which person it's referring to.

The sentence states that ""Tom has been working out and wants to have sex with Akos but he is not into it."" The key phrase here is ""but he is not into it."" This contrasts with the earlier part of the sentence about Tom wanting to have sex. 

Logically, it wouldn't make sense for Tom to both want to have sex and not be into it. Therefore, ""he"" must refer to Akos, who is not interested in having sex with Tom.",1,1
1808,"There, menacing man wants to kill the Woggle-Bug, but he convinces him that his death would bring bad luck.",he,"0: menacing man, 1: the Woggle-Bug, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which entity the pronoun ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence mentions two male entities: ""menacing man"" and ""the Woggle-Bug"".
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""he convinces him"".
3. The action of convincing is being performed by one entity on the other.
4. Given the context, it's more logical that the Woggle-Bug would be trying to convince the menacing man not to kill him, rather than the other way around.

Therefore, ""he"" in this context most likely refers to ""the Woggle-Bug"" who is convincing the menacing man not to kill him.",1,1
1809,"Mr. Manning is initially unwilling to let the child go, but with guidance from Dr. Gates, he finally accepts the inevitable.",he,"0: the child, 1: Mr. Manning, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Mr. Manning for the following reasons:

1. Mr. Manning is the main subject of the sentence and is mentioned first.
2. The sentence describes Mr. Manning's actions and feelings (being unwilling, accepting the inevitable).
3. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the context of accepting something, which aligns with Mr. Manning's described behavior.
4. ""The child"" is mentioned as an object in the sentence, not as the main actor.
5. Dr. Gates is mentioned as providing guidance, but is not the main focus of the sentence.

Therefore, it is most logical that ""he"" refers to Mr. Manning in this context.",1,1
1810,"Nigel and his girlfriend leave ahead of Jenny and Vicky, so that they can prepare the farm for their arrival.",they,"0: Nigel and his girlfriend, 1: Jenny and Vicky, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" most likely refers to Nigel and his girlfriend. The context suggests that Nigel and his girlfriend are leaving ahead of Jenny and Vicky for a specific purpose: to prepare the farm for Jenny and Vicky's arrival. This implies that ""they"" (Nigel and his girlfriend) are the ones doing the preparing, while Jenny and Vicky are the ones arriving later. The phrase ""so that they can prepare"" directly links the action of leaving ahead with the purpose of preparing, which is logically performed by those who leave first.",0,0
1811,"Sister Jaime adopts Ella, but Patricia has a constant dislike against her.",her,"0: Ella, 1: Sister Jaime, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""her"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. Sister Jaime adopts Ella
2. Patricia has a constant dislike against her

The pronoun ""her"" is most likely referring to Ella for the following reasons:
1. Ella is the most recently mentioned person before the pronoun, making her the most likely referent.
2. It's more logical that Patricia would have a dislike for Ella (the adopted child) rather than Sister Jaime (the adopter).
3. If ""her"" referred to Sister Jaime, it would be more natural to use her name or title again for clarity.

Therefore, the pronoun ""her"" most likely refers to Ella.",0,0
1812,"Yifei wants to have sexual intercourse with Soo Hee, but she bought twin beds instead of one big bed, and refused her advances.",she,"0: Soo Hee, 1: Yifei, 2: Neither","Let's analyze the sentence to determine who ""she"" refers to:

1. The sentence starts with ""Yifei wants to have sexual intercourse with Soo Hee""
2. Then it says ""but she bought twin beds instead of one big bed""
3. Finally, it mentions ""and refused her advances""

The pronoun ""she"" is performing two actions here:
1. Buying twin beds
2. Refusing advances

These actions are in opposition to Yifei's desire for sexual intercourse. Therefore, it's logical to conclude that ""she"" refers to Soo Hee, as Soo Hee is the one who seems to be rejecting Yifei's advances by buying separate beds and refusing her advances.",0,0
1813,"Anna seduces Kimberly so she will testify in her favor, but her appeal is unsuccessful.",she,"0: Anna, 1: Kimberly, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. ""Anna seduces Kimberly"" - This establishes Anna as the active subject and Kimberly as the object of the seduction.

2. ""so she will testify in her favor"" - Here, ""she"" refers to Kimberly, not Anna. The reason for this is:
   a) It makes more sense in the context of seduction that Anna is trying to get Kimberly to testify in Anna's favor.
   b) If ""she"" referred to Anna, it would mean Anna is testifying in her own favor, which wouldn't require seduction.

3. ""but her appeal is unsuccessful"" - This ""her"" likely refers to Anna, as she would be the one making an appeal (presumably in a legal context) for which she needed favorable testimony.

However, the pronoun we're specifically asked about is the first ""she"" in the sentence, which refers to Kimberly as explained in point 2.",1,1
1814,"Emma tries to stay away from Lily, but she realizes that she is in love with her.",she,"0: Emma, 1: Lily, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""she"" the pronoun refers to. The sentence structure suggests that ""she"" refers to Emma for the following reasons:

1. Emma is the subject of the first clause, making her the primary focus of the sentence.
2. The sentence describes Emma's actions and feelings, with Lily being the object of those feelings.
3. The phrase ""she realizes"" is more likely to refer to Emma's realization about her own feelings, rather than Lily's.
4. The use of ""her"" at the end of the sentence likely refers to Lily, indicating that Emma is the one who is in love with Lily.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" in this context most likely refers to Emma.",0,0
1815,"Audrey start neglecting Sophie, but when she prevents his friends from embarrassing her in public, they become close friends again.",she,"0: Audrey, 1: Sophie, 2: Neither","In this sentence, there are two instances of 'she' that need to be analyzed. Let's break it down:

1. The first 'she' in 'when she prevents' likely refers to Audrey. This is because Audrey is the subject of the first clause and is performing an action (preventing) that changes the relationship dynamics.

2. The second 'her' in 'embarrassing her in public' refers to Sophie. This is clear because Sophie is the object of Audrey's protective action.

The pronoun we're specifically asked about is 'she', which in this case refers to Audrey. Audrey is the one taking action to prevent Sophie from being embarrassed, which leads to them becoming close friends again.",1,0
1816,"Lea tries to let Sophie down gently, but she manages to upset her.",she,"0: Lea, 1: Sophie, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Lea is trying to let Sophie down gently.
2. Someone (""she"") manages to upset someone else (""her"").

Given the structure of the sentence, it's more likely that ""she"" refers to Lea, the subject of the first clause. The sentence implies that despite Lea's attempt to be gentle, she still ends up upsetting Sophie. This interpretation makes the most logical sense in the context.

If ""she"" referred to Sophie, the sentence would be less coherent, as it would suggest that Sophie is somehow upsetting herself while Lea is trying to let her down gently.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Lea.",0,0
1817,"Minogue originally auditioned for the role of Marilyn Chambers, but she was later cast in the role of Emma instead.",she,"0: Minogue, 1: Marilyn Chambers, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" clearly refers to Minogue. The sentence is describing Minogue's casting process, stating that she initially auditioned for one role (Marilyn Chambers) but was ultimately cast in a different role (Emma). The pronoun ""she"" is used to continue referring to Minogue throughout the sentence, maintaining her as the subject of the action. There's no ambiguity in this case, as Marilyn Chambers is only mentioned as the name of a role, not as a person taking any action in the sentence.",0,0
1818,"Claire tries to win Kate back, but she makes it clear that they are never getting back together.",she,"0: Claire, 1: Kate, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Kate. The context suggests that Claire is trying to win Kate back, but Kate (referred to as ""she"") is the one making it clear that they won't be getting back together. This interpretation aligns with the typical structure of such statements, where the person being pursued is the one to reject the possibility of reconciliation.",1,1
1819,Anna misses Cathy so much that she decides to kill herself.,she,"0: Anna, 1: Cathy, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and logical flow of the sentence:

1. The sentence starts with ""Anna misses Cathy.""
2. This is followed by ""so much that she decides to kill herself.""

The pronoun ""she"" is more likely to refer to Anna for the following reasons:
1. Anna is the subject of the main clause and the sentence's focus.
2. The action of missing someone typically leads to emotional distress for the person doing the missing, not the one being missed.
3. The extreme action of deciding to kill oneself is more logically connected to the person experiencing the intense feeling of missing someone.

Therefore, it is most probable that Anna is the one who decides to kill herself due to missing Cathy so much.",0,0
1820,"Ludivine tries to admit to killing Lola, but Helen stops her, revealing she did it.",her,"0: Ludivine, 1: Lola, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""her"" appears twice. Let's analyze each occurrence:

1. ""Helen stops her"": In this case, ""her"" refers to Ludivine, as Helen is stopping Ludivine from admitting to the killing.

2. ""revealing she did it"": This ""she"" refers to Helen, not Ludivine or Lola. However, we're not asked about this pronoun.

The question specifically asks about the pronoun ""her,"" which in this context clearly refers to Ludivine. Ludivine is trying to admit something, and Helen stops her (Ludivine) from doing so.

Lola is mentioned as the victim of the killing, not as someone being stopped or trying to admit something.

Therefore, the pronoun ""her"" refers to Ludivine, which is candidate 0.",0,0
1821,Next Doina asks Sally if she would like to go out but she refuses.,she,"0: Sally, 1: Doina, 2: Neither","In this sentence, there are two instances of ""she"":

1. ""...if she would like to go out...""
2. ""...but she refuses.""

Let's analyze each:

1. The first ""she"" refers to Sally because Doina is asking Sally if she (Sally) would like to go out.
2. The second ""she"" also refers to Sally because it's stating that she (Sally) refuses the invitation.

Both instances of ""she"" in this sentence refer to Sally. The pronoun ""she"" is used to avoid repeating Sally's name in the sentence. Doina is the one doing the asking, so she is not the subject of either ""she"" pronoun.",0,0
1822,Arvin tries to bring back Henry but he refuses to love him.,he,"0: Arvin, 1: Henry, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Arvin is trying to bring back Henry.
2. ""he refuses to love him""

The pronoun ""he"" is more likely to refer to Henry in this context because:
1. Henry is the object of Arvin's action (trying to bring back).
2. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" is responding to Arvin's attempt by refusing.
3. It would be unusual for Arvin to refuse to love himself, so ""him"" likely refers back to Arvin.

Therefore, ""he"" most likely refers to Henry (candidate 1).",1,1
1823,"At first, Adam does not much care for Bill either, but he eventually wins his affections.",he,"0: Bill, 1: Adam, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""At first, Adam does not much care for Bill either...""
2. Then it continues with ""...but he eventually wins his affections.""

The pronoun ""he"" in this context is more likely to refer to Bill because:

1. Bill is the object of Adam's initial dislike.
2. The sentence structure suggests a change in Adam's feelings towards Bill.
3. It would make more sense for Bill to win Adam's affections, rather than Adam winning his own affections.

Therefore, ""he"" most likely refers to Bill, who eventually wins Adam's affections despite Adam's initial dislike.",0,0
1824,"Jessica contemplates leaving Emma, but when she does, she reacts angrily and cruelly reminds her of her shortcomings before kicking her out.",she,"0: Jessica, 1: Emma, 2: Neither","In this sentence, there are two instances of 'she' that refer to different people. Let's analyze them:

1. The first 'she' in 'when she does' refers to Jessica. This is because Jessica is the subject of the first clause and is contemplating leaving Emma.

2. The second 'she' in 'she reacts angrily' refers to Emma. This is evident from the context, as Emma is the one reacting to Jessica's potential departure.

3. The pronoun 'her' is used twice at the end, both referring to Emma (Jessica reminds Emma of Emma's shortcomings and kicks Emma out).

The question asks specifically about the pronoun 'she', without specifying which instance. Since 'she' refers to both Jessica and Emma in different parts of the sentence, we cannot definitively assign it to just one of them.",0,2
1825,"Loretta grows close to Violetta and, although initially hesitant, forms a relationship with her.",her,"0: Loretta, 1: Violetta, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""her"" refers to Violetta. The sentence structure indicates that Loretta is the subject who is forming a relationship with someone else. The pronoun ""her"" is used at the end of the sentence to refer back to Violetta, who was mentioned immediately before. This makes sense contextually, as Loretta is growing close to Violetta and forming a relationship with her (Violetta).",1,1
1826,"Sheila attempts to kill Kim, but she is herself killed by one of her men.",she,"0: Sheila, 1: Kim, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Sheila attempts to kill Kim.
2. ""She"" is killed by one of her men.

The pronoun ""she"" is more likely to refer to Sheila for the following reasons:
1. Sheila is the subject of the first clause and the main actor in the sentence.
2. The sentence structure suggests a turn of events where the initial aggressor (Sheila) becomes the victim.
3. The phrase ""one of her men"" implies that the person being referred to has authority or leadership over a group of men, which is more likely to be true for Sheila (the initial aggressor) than Kim (the initial target).

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Sheila.",0,0
1827,"Natalia goes to Joyces, but she is rebuffed by her former employer.",her,"0: Natalia, 1: Joyces, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""her"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence mentions two people: Natalia and Joyce.
2. ""her"" is used in the phrase ""her former employer.""
3. The sentence structure suggests that Natalia is the subject who goes to Joyce's place.
4. It's more likely that Joyce is the former employer, not Natalia.

Given this analysis, ""her"" most likely refers to Joyce, as she is the one being described as the former employer. Natalia is the one being rebuffed, so she is not the referent of ""her"" in this context.",0,1
1828,"Plutarch describes there being many accusers against Trebonius, but no one to defend him.",him,"0: Plutarch, 1: Trebonius, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""him"" clearly refers to Trebonius for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure indicates that Trebonius is the subject of the accusation.
2. Plutarch is mentioned as the one describing the situation, not as the one being accused or defended.
3. The pronoun ""him"" is used in the context of someone who needs defense, which aligns with Trebonius being the accused party.

Therefore, the pronoun ""him"" refers to Trebonius, not Plutarch or any other entity not mentioned in the text.",1,1
1829,"Muriel Emms wrote a biography of McHugh, but she was unable to come to terms with a publisher.",she,"0: McHugh, 1: Muriel Emms, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Muriel Emms for the following reasons:

1. Muriel Emms is the subject of the main clause and the most recently mentioned person in the sentence.
2. The action of being ""unable to come to terms with a publisher"" is more logically associated with the author of the biography (Muriel Emms) rather than the subject of the biography (McHugh).
3. It's common in English for a pronoun to refer to the subject of the previous clause when there's no clear indication otherwise.

Therefore, ""she"" in this context refers to Muriel Emms, who wrote the biography and was trying to get it published.",0,1
1830,"Lola tries to find out from Jenny if Joe is staying at the settlement house, but she refuses to divulge anything.",she,"0: Lola, 1: Jenny, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" refers to Jenny. We can determine this because:

1. The sentence structure indicates that Lola is trying to get information from Jenny.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the context of refusing to divulge information.
3. It wouldn't make sense for Lola to refuse to divulge information to herself.
4. The action of refusing to divulge information is logically attributed to Jenny, as she is the one being asked about Joe's whereabouts.

Therefore, ""she"" in this context refers to Jenny, who is refusing to provide information to Lola.",1,1
1831,"Alice reveals that when Diane was unconscious earlier, she took some of her blood and mixed it with her own in the jar.",she,"0: Alice, 1: Diane, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Alice is the subject of the main clause, revealing information about an action.
2. The action described is that someone ""took some of her blood and mixed it with her own in the jar.""
3. The pronoun ""she"" is used to describe the person who performed this action.
4. It's stated that this happened ""when Diane was unconscious,"" which implies Diane couldn't have been the one taking the blood.

Given this information, it's clear that Alice is the one who took the blood and mixed it. The pronoun ""she"" refers to Alice, as she is the active participant in this scenario, while Diane is described as being unconscious.",0,0
1832,"Meg suggests that Brenda begin to investigate, but she is reluctant to do so, explaining that she moved from Baltimore to avoid murder cases.",she,"0: Meg, 1: Brenda, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. Meg suggests that Brenda begin to investigate.
2. ""She"" is reluctant to do so.
3. ""She"" explains that she moved from Baltimore to avoid murder cases.

The pronoun ""she"" is more likely to refer to Brenda for the following reasons:
1. Brenda is the subject of the suggestion (to begin investigating).
2. The reluctance to investigate is more likely to come from the person being asked to do so (Brenda) rather than the person making the suggestion (Meg).
3. The explanation about moving from Baltimore to avoid murder cases provides additional context that is more likely to apply to Brenda, as it explains her reluctance to investigate.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Brenda.",1,1
1833,Joelle is rude and dismissive to Miriam's colleagues but she remains steadfastly faithful to her despite her picaresque behaviour.,she,"0: Joelle, 1: Miriam, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. ""Joelle is rude and dismissive to Miriam's colleagues"" - This establishes Joelle as the subject who is behaving rudely.

2. ""but she remains steadfastly faithful to her"" - Here, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to.

3. The use of ""but"" suggests a contrast. The contrast is between Joelle's rude behavior and someone's faithfulness.

4. It wouldn't make sense for Joelle to be faithful to herself, so ""she"" is more likely referring to Miriam.

5. ""despite her picaresque behaviour"" - This further confirms that ""she"" refers to Miriam, as it's Joelle's behavior that has been described as problematic.

Therefore, ""she"" in this context most likely refers to Miriam, who remains faithful to Joelle despite Joelle's rude behavior.",0,1
1834,"Alexandra asks Lenore out, but she rebuffs her and instead invites Kato to dinner, making Alexandra jealous.",she,"0: Alexandra, 1: Lenore, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Alexandra asks Lenore out.
2. ""She"" rebuffs ""her"".
3. ""She"" invites Kato to dinner.
4. This makes Alexandra jealous.

Given this sequence of events, we can deduce that ""she"" refers to Lenore because:
- Lenore is the one being asked out, so she would be in a position to rebuff.
- The person doing the rebuffing (Lenore) is also the one inviting Kato to dinner.
- Alexandra is described as becoming jealous, which makes sense if Lenore (the person she asked out) is inviting someone else to dinner.

Therefore, ""she"" in this context refers to Lenore.",1,1
1835,Melinda regrets leaving Annie but she refuses to take her back.,she,"0: Melinda, 1: Annie, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Melinda is the subject of the first clause, ""Melinda regrets leaving Annie.""
2. The second clause, ""but she refuses to take her back,"" is connected to the first clause with ""but,"" indicating a contrast or opposition.
3. The action of ""refusing to take her back"" logically follows the action of ""leaving."" It makes more sense for the person who left (Melinda) to be the one refusing to take the other person back.
4. Grammatically, ""she"" is more likely to refer to the subject of the previous clause (Melinda) unless there's a clear indication otherwise.

Given these points, it's most logical that ""she"" refers to Melinda. Melinda is the one who left Annie, and now Melinda is the one refusing to take Annie back, despite regretting leaving her.",1,0
1836,Zoe attempts to kill Erica but she manages to escape.,she,"0: Erica, 1: Zoe, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Erica. The sentence structure suggests that Zoe is the attacker and Erica is the one who escapes. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the context of managing to escape, which logically applies to Erica, the person being attacked. It wouldn't make sense for Zoe, the attacker, to be escaping in this scenario.",0,0
1837,"Paulina sincerely loves Anne, but she feels her to be increasingly cold and indifferent.",she,"0: Paulina, 1: Anne, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Paulina sincerely loves Anne.""
2. Then it says ""but she feels her to be increasingly cold and indifferent.""

The pronoun ""she"" is more likely to refer to Paulina for the following reasons:
1. Paulina is the subject of the first clause and the main actor in the sentence.
2. The sentence structure suggests a contrast between Paulina's feelings and Anne's behavior.
3. It would make more sense for Paulina to be the one feeling that Anne is cold and indifferent, rather than Anne feeling that way about herself.

Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Paulina.",0,0
1838,"Beatrice tries to convince Katie to go back inside, but she refuses and appears to remember none of it the next day.",she,"0: Beatrice, 1: Katie, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which person the pronoun ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Beatrice is trying to convince Katie to go back inside.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""she refuses"".
3. The sentence then mentions ""appears to remember none of it the next day"".

Given this information, it's more logical that ""she"" refers to Katie because:
1. Katie is the object of Beatrice's convincing, so she would be the one to refuse.
2. The act of refusing aligns with the person being convinced, not the one doing the convincing.
3. The phrase ""appears to remember none of it the next day"" suggests that the person who refused (Katie) is the one who doesn't remember the incident.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Katie.",1,1
1839,"Katie finally calls the demonologist, Dr. Averies, but she is unavailable.",she,"0: Katie, 1: the demonologist , Dr. Averies, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who the pronoun ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Katie is mentioned first in the sentence as the subject who calls the demonologist.
2. Dr. Averies is mentioned second as the person Katie is trying to reach.
3. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""but she is unavailable.""

Given the structure of the sentence, it's more likely that ""she"" refers to Dr. Averies rather than Katie. This is because:

1. The sentence is describing Katie's action of calling Dr. Averies.
2. The ""but"" clause introduces a contrast to this action, implying that the call was not successful.
3. It would be more natural to say that the person being called (Dr. Averies) is unavailable, rather than the caller (Katie).

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Dr. Averies, the demonologist.",1,1
1840,Moira notices and warns Eve off when she believes she is getting too familiar with John.,she,"0: Eve, 1: Moira, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Moira is the subject of the sentence and is performing the actions of noticing and warning.
2. Eve is the object of Moira's warning.
3. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""when she believes she is getting too familiar with John.""

Given this structure, it's more likely that ""she"" refers to Eve rather than Moira. The sentence is describing Moira's perception of Eve's behavior towards John. Moira is warning Eve because Moira believes that Eve (not Moira herself) is getting too familiar with John.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" in this context most likely refers to Eve.",0,0
1841,"Felindra tries to ask Ann out, but she declines out of respect for Leslie's friendship.",she,"0: Felindra, 1: Ann, 2: Neither","Let's analyze the sentence to determine who ""she"" refers to:

1. The sentence mentions two people: Felindra and Ann.
2. The action described is Felindra asking Ann out.
3. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the context of declining.
4. The reason for declining is given as ""out of respect for Leslie's friendship.""

Given this information, it's clear that ""she"" refers to Ann because:
- Ann is the one being asked out, so she would be in the position to decline.
- The reason for declining (respect for Leslie's friendship) is more likely to be Ann's motivation, as she is the one making the decision to decline.
- Grammatically, ""she"" is closer to ""Ann"" in the sentence, which is often (but not always) an indicator of the pronoun's referent.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" refers to Ann.",1,1
1842,"Claire constantly interrupt Elise sleep, so that in the courtroom she is on the edge of falling asleep.",she,"0: Elise, 1: Claire, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, let's analyze the sentence:

""Claire constantly interrupt Elise sleep, so that in the courtroom she is on the edge of falling asleep.""

The pronoun ""she"" is used in the context of someone being on the edge of falling asleep in the courtroom. This state is a direct result of having their sleep constantly interrupted.

In this sentence, Claire is the one interrupting Elise's sleep. As a consequence of this interruption, someone is on the edge of falling asleep in the courtroom. Logically, the person who would be sleepy is the one whose sleep was interrupted, which is Elise.

Therefore, ""she"" in this context most likely refers to Elise, as she is the one whose sleep was disrupted, leading to her being sleepy in the courtroom.",0,0
1843,Bree is starting to fall in love with Emilie so she decides to end the affair.,she,"0: Bree, 1: Emilie, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" refers to Bree for the following reasons:

1. Bree is the subject of the first part of the sentence, making her the most prominent character.
2. The sentence describes Bree's feelings and actions: she is falling in love with Emilie and decides to end the affair.
3. It's more logical that the person ending the affair is the one making the decision, which in this case is Bree.
4. The structure of the sentence suggests that ""she"" refers back to the subject (Bree) rather than the object (Emilie) of the first clause.

Therefore, ""she"" in this context most likely refers to Bree.",0,0
1844,"Maud wants to forgive Victoria, but she says nothing in her own defence.",she,"0: Maud, 1: Victoria, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence has two parts separated by ""but"":
   - ""Maud wants to forgive Victoria""
   - ""she says nothing in her own defence""

2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the second part of the sentence.

3. Logically, the person who would need to say something in their own defense would be Victoria, not Maud.

4. Maud is the one who wants to forgive, so she wouldn't need to defend herself.

5. The phrase ""in her own defence"" implies that Victoria is the one who needs to defend herself, as she is the one being forgiven.

Therefore, based on the context and logical flow of the sentence, ""she"" most likely refers to Victoria.",1,1
1845,"Diti wants to date Layla, but she is no longer interested.",she,"0: Diti, 1: Layla, 2: Neither","To determine who ""she"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and meaning:

1. The sentence starts with ""Diti wants to date Layla""
2. It then says ""but she is no longer interested""

The use of ""but"" indicates a contrast or change in the situation. Since Diti is the one who wants to date Layla, it would make more sense if Layla is the one who is no longer interested. If Diti was no longer interested, there would be no need to mention that she wants to date Layla in the first place.

Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Layla, as she is the one who is no longer interested in the potential relationship that Diti desires.",1,1
1846,May complains of head pains but Christine thinks she's attention seeking.,she,"0: May, 1: Christine, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. May is mentioned first, complaining of head pains.
2. Christine is mentioned second, thinking something about ""she.""
3. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the context of someone being perceived as attention-seeking.

Given this information, it's more likely that ""she"" refers to May for the following reasons:
- May is the one with the complaint (head pains), which could be perceived as attention-seeking behavior.
- Christine is the one doing the thinking about someone else, and it wouldn't make sense for her to think of herself as attention-seeking in this context.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to May.",0,0
1847,"Carol defends Juliana, but then finds out that she is in possession of stolen jewellery, and throws her out again.",she,"0: Carol, 1: Juliana, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. Carol defends Juliana initially.
2. Then Carol finds out something about ""she.""
3. As a result, Carol throws ""her"" out again.

The pronoun ""she"" in this context is most likely referring to Juliana for the following reasons:
1. It wouldn't make sense for Carol to throw herself out.
2. The sentence structure suggests that ""she"" is the person being defended and then thrown out, which is Juliana.
3. The possession of stolen jewelry is new information that Carol discovers about someone else, not about herself.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" in this sentence refers to Juliana.",1,1
1848,"Finally, Lekha fortuitously comes to know the real story of Layla Rao but she is moved by her life struggles.",she,"0: Lekha, 1: Layla Rao, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions two people: Lekha and Layla Rao.
2. The first part of the sentence is about Lekha: ""Finally, Lekha fortuitously comes to know the real story of Layla Rao""
3. The second part of the sentence, which contains the pronoun ""she,"" states: ""but she is moved by her life struggles.""
4. Logically, the person who would be moved by someone's life struggles is the one who just learned about their story.
5. Since Lekha is the one who ""comes to know the real story of Layla Rao,"" it makes sense that Lekha would be the one moved by Layla Rao's life struggles.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" in this sentence most likely refers to Lekha.",0,0
1849,"Derek tried to reach the Patriarch, but he was powerless to do anything to solve the situation.",he,"0: Derek, 1: the Patriarch, 2: Neither","To determine who the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and structure of the sentence:

1. The sentence starts with ""Derek tried to reach the Patriarch.""
2. The second part of the sentence, after the comma, says ""but he was powerless to do anything to solve the situation.""

The pronoun ""he"" is more likely to refer to Derek for the following reasons:
1. Derek is the subject of the first clause and the main actor in the sentence.
2. The sentence structure suggests that the person who tried to reach the Patriarch (Derek) is the same person who was powerless.
3. It would be less logical for the Patriarch to be powerless in this context, as he is likely in a position of authority (given his title).

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Derek.",1,0
1850,"Now Sylvie is head over heels in love with Piya, but she wo n't accept her.",she,"0: Sylvie, 1: Piya, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which person ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Now Sylvie is head over heels in love with Piya""
2. The second part of the sentence says ""but she won't accept her""

Given this structure, it's more likely that ""she"" refers to Piya, not Sylvie. The reasoning is:

1. Sylvie is the subject of the first clause and is described as being in love with Piya.
2. The ""but"" introduces a contrasting idea, suggesting a change in subject.
3. ""She won't accept her"" implies that the person being referred to (Piya) is not accepting the other person (Sylvie).

Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Piya in this context.",1,1
1851,"Latifa attempts to get rid of Grena, but a fight ensues and she is the one killed.",she,"0: Latifa, 1: Grena, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Latifa attempts to get rid of Grena.""
2. Then it says ""but a fight ensues.""
3. Finally, it states ""and she is the one killed.""

The pronoun ""she"" is used in the last part of the sentence, referring to the person who was killed. The sentence structure suggests that this is contrary to Latifa's initial intention (indicated by ""but""). 

Latifa is the subject of the first part of the sentence, attempting to get rid of Grena. However, the outcome is unexpected - ""she is the one killed."" This unexpected turn of events implies that the person killed is not the one doing the action at the beginning of the sentence.

Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Latifa, as she is the one who ends up being killed, contrary to her initial attempt to get rid of Grena.",0,0
1852,"Jacqui agrees to sleep with Mai Ly, but she explains she loves Rhys.",she,"0: Jacqui, 1: Mai Ly, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""she"" refers to: Jacqui or Mai Ly. The key is in the second part of the sentence: ""she explains she loves Rhys."" This information is more likely to be about Jacqui than Mai Ly for a few reasons:

1. Jacqui is the subject of the first part of the sentence, making her the more prominent character.
2. The sentence structure suggests that the ""she"" who explains is the same person who agreed to sleep with Mai Ly, which is Jacqui.
3. It would be somewhat unusual for Mai Ly to explain her love for Rhys in this context, especially right after Jacqui has agreed to sleep with her.

Therefore, it's most logical that ""she"" refers to Jacqui in this sentence.",0,0
1853,"Lisa follows Wendy, finding out where she lives and works.",she,"0: Wendy, 1: Lisa, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Lisa is the subject of the sentence, performing the action of following.
2. Wendy is the object being followed.
3. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""where she lives and works.""

Given this information, it's more logical that Lisa would be trying to find out where Wendy lives and works, rather than Lisa trying to find out about her own living and working situation. Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Wendy.",0,0
1854,"Libby suspends Vicky, so Susan gets her a part-time job at the local garden nursery.",her,"0: Libby, 1: Vicky, 2: Neither","Let's analyze the sentence to determine who ""her"" refers to:

1. Libby suspends Vicky
2. Susan gets ""her"" a part-time job

The pronoun ""her"" is most likely referring to Vicky for the following reasons:
1. Vicky is the person who has been suspended, which implies she is no longer working or in school.
2. It makes logical sense that Susan would get a part-time job for the person who has been suspended (Vicky) rather than for the person who did the suspending (Libby).
3. The sentence structure suggests that the action of getting a job is a consequence of or response to the suspension, further indicating that ""her"" refers to the suspended person (Vicky).

Therefore, the pronoun ""her"" most likely refers to Vicky.",1,1
1855,"Then the men try to shoot Gambit, but Cable saves him.",him,"0: the men, 1: Gambit, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""him"" refers to Gambit for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure indicates that ""the men"" are the subject performing the action of trying to shoot someone.
2. Gambit is mentioned as the object of this action, being the one who is being shot at.
3. The pronoun ""him"" is used in the second part of the sentence, where Cable is saving someone.
4. It makes logical sense that Cable would be saving the person being shot at (Gambit) rather than the shooters (the men).

Therefore, the pronoun ""him"" most likely refers to Gambit.",1,1
1856,"Ciccio is going to get married to Miranda, but she leaves him the day of their marriage.",she,"0: Ciccio, 1: Miranda, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" clearly refers to Miranda. The context indicates that Ciccio is going to marry Miranda, but ""she"" (Miranda) leaves him on their wedding day. The pronoun ""she"" is used to avoid repeating Miranda's name and maintains the flow of the sentence while clearly indicating that Miranda is the one who leaves.",1,1
1857,"Yolande proposes to Gina, but, to her shock, she is rejected.",her,"0: Yolande, 1: Gina, 2: Neither","To determine who ""her"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and the most logical interpretation:

1. Yolande proposes to Gina.
2. Someone experiences shock.
3. Someone is rejected.

The pronoun ""her"" is used in the phrase ""to her shock,"" which indicates that the person experiencing shock is the one being referred to.

Given the context, it's most logical that Yolande, who proposed, would be the one experiencing shock at being rejected. It wouldn't make sense for Gina to be shocked at rejecting a proposal she didn't want to accept.

Therefore, ""her"" most likely refers to Yolande, as she would be the one shocked at being rejected after proposing.",0,0
1858,Melanie turns Victoria down but then realizes that she is still in love with her.,she,"0: Melanie, 1: Victoria, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""she is still in love with her."" Given the context, it makes more sense that Melanie is the one who realizes she is still in love with Victoria. This interpretation aligns with the narrative flow:

1. Melanie turns Victoria down (initially rejecting her)
2. Then Melanie realizes something about her own feelings
3. The realization is that she (Melanie) is still in love with her (Victoria)

It wouldn't make as much sense for Victoria to realize she's in love with Melanie in this context, especially after being turned down. Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Melanie.",0,0
1859,"Lindy is initially glad to be rid of Alice, but soon regrets her decision.",her,"0: Lindy, 1: Alice, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""her"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions two people: Lindy and Alice.
2. The pronoun ""her"" is used in the phrase ""her decision.""
3. The sentence structure indicates that Lindy is the subject who is making and regretting a decision.
4. It's more logical that Lindy would regret her own decision rather than Alice's decision.

Based on these points, it's clear that ""her"" refers to Lindy. The decision being regretted is Lindy's decision to be rid of Alice.",1,0
1860,"Mia can not bring herself to ask Jennifer out, so Tracy decides to help her.",her,"0: Mia, 1: Jennifer, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""her"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Mia is the subject of the first clause, unable to ask Jennifer out.
2. Tracy is introduced as someone who decides to help.
3. The pronoun ""her"" is used at the end of the sentence, referring to the person Tracy is helping.

Given this information, it's most logical that Tracy is helping Mia, as Mia is the one who can't bring herself to ask Jennifer out. Therefore, ""her"" most likely refers to Mia.",0,0
1861,Deva tells Krishna to go after Mr. Hook while she heals Professor Gellar.,she,"0: Deva, 1: Krishna, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" clearly refers to Deva. We can determine this because:

1. Deva is the subject of the sentence and is performing the action of telling Krishna what to do.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the context of healing Professor Gellar, which is an action attributed to Deva in the sentence.
3. Krishna is referred to as ""he"" (implied by the name Krishna, which is typically masculine), so ""she"" cannot refer to Krishna.
4. There are no other female characters mentioned in the sentence that could be referred to by ""she"".

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" unambiguously refers to Deva.",1,0
1862,"Gene Tierney was initially set to star as Mrs. Mary Dean, but she dropped out last minute due to illness.",she,"0: Mrs. Mary Dean, 1: Gene Tierney, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" clearly refers to Gene Tierney. The sentence states that Gene Tierney was initially set to star as Mrs. Mary Dean, but ""she"" dropped out last minute due to illness. The pronoun ""she"" is used to avoid repeating Gene Tierney's name, and it logically follows that Gene Tierney is the one who dropped out, not the character Mrs. Mary Dean. Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" refers to Gene Tierney (candidate 1).",1,1
1863,"Qatar national team coach Philippe Troussier had called up Enazi, but due to his ban he was unable to join the national team.",his,"0: Enazi, 1: Qatar national team coach Philippe Troussier, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""his"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence mentions two individuals: Philippe Troussier and Enazi.
2. The pronoun ""his"" is used in the phrase ""due to his ban"".
3. The sentence structure suggests that Enazi was called up but couldn't join the team due to a ban.
4. It's more logical that a player (Enazi) would be banned from joining the team rather than the coach (Troussier).

Based on this analysis, it's clear that ""his"" refers to Enazi's ban, not Troussier's. Therefore, the pronoun ""his"" refers to Enazi.",1,0
1864,"Hatsuko seduces Kumi, but she is frustrated when she refuses to perform oral sex on her.",she,"0: Hatsuko, 1: Kumi, 2: Neither","In this sentence, there are multiple instances of the pronoun ""she,"" and we need to determine which one refers to either Hatsuko or Kumi. Let's break it down:

1. ""Hatsuko seduces Kumi"" - This establishes the initial action and the two characters involved.
2. ""but she is frustrated"" - This ""she"" likely refers to Hatsuko, as she is the one performing the action of seducing and would be the one to feel frustrated if her advances are not fully reciprocated.
3. ""when she refuses"" - This ""she"" refers to Kumi, as she is the one refusing to perform the requested act.
4. ""to perform oral sex on her"" - This ""her"" refers back to Hatsuko, as she is the one who initiated the seduction.

Given that the question asks about the first instance of ""she"" in the sentence, which is ""but she is frustrated,"" we can conclude that this pronoun refers to Hatsuko.",1,"0

1865,"However, Indira is now a single mother of ten-year-old girl after her ex-husband went to jail.",her,"0: ten-year-old girl, 1: Indira, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""her"" is referring to Indira. The context clearly indicates that Indira is the subject of the sentence and the mother of the ten-year-old girl. The phrase ""her ex-husband"" further confirms that ""her"" is referring to Indira, as it's describing Indira's relationship to the ex-husband. The ten-year-old girl is mentioned as Indira's daughter, not as the subject of the sentence, so ""her"" cannot be referring to the girl.",1,1
1866,Lucia arrives as well in search of Lorane and demanding to know where she is.,she,"0: Lucia, 1: Lorane, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine whether the pronoun ""she"" refers to Lucia, Lorane, or neither. Let's analyze the context:

1. Lucia is mentioned first as the subject of the sentence, arriving and searching for Lorane.
2. Lorane is mentioned second as the person Lucia is looking for.
3. The pronoun ""she"" appears in the phrase ""where she is,"" which is part of what Lucia is demanding to know.

Given this context, it's clear that ""she"" refers to Lorane, not Lucia. Lucia is the one asking about Lorane's whereabouts, so ""she"" must be referring to Lorane.",1,1
1867,Yue is now arrested by Melinda but she manages to get bail.,she,"0: Yue, 1: Melinda, 2: Neither","To determine who ""she"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and the logical flow of events:

1. The sentence starts with ""Yue is now arrested by Melinda"".
2. Then it says ""but she manages to get bail"".

The use of ""but"" indicates a contrast or unexpected outcome. If Melinda had gotten bail, it wouldn't be unexpected or contrasting, as she's the one doing the arresting. However, for Yue to get bail after being arrested would be a contrasting event.

Therefore, it's most logical that ""she"" refers to Yue, as Yue is the one who has been arrested and would be the one needing and getting bail.",0,0
1868,"Sandra tries to buy back the coin from Diana, but she refuses because she needs the coin to complete the collection she started with her own dead father.",she,"0: Sandra, 1: Diana, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. Sandra tries to buy back the coin from Diana.
2. ""but she refuses"" - This ""she"" refers to Diana, as she is the one refusing to sell the coin back.
3. ""because she needs the coin"" - This ""she"" also refers to Diana, as it's explaining her reason for refusing.
4. ""to complete the collection she started with her own dead father"" - This ""she"" and ""her"" also refer to Diana, as it's describing Diana's personal connection to the coin and collection.

Both instances of ""she"" in this sentence refer to Diana. Diana is the one refusing to sell the coin and needing it for her collection. Sandra is only mentioned as the one trying to buy the coin back, but she's not the subject of the pronouns in question.",1,1
1869,Aruna still loves Diana but she hates her and has turned into a drunk womanizer again.,she,"0: Aruna, 1: Diana, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun 'she' most likely refers to Diana (candidate 1) for the following reasons:
1. The sentence structure suggests a contrast between Aruna's feelings and Diana's actions.
2. 'Aruna still loves Diana' indicates Aruna's positive feelings towards Diana.
3. 'but she hates her' implies that the subject ('she') has negative feelings towards the object ('her').
4. It would be illogical for Aruna to both love and hate Diana simultaneously.
5. The phrase 'has turned into a drunk womanizer again' is more likely to describe Diana's behavior as a change, contrasting with Aruna's consistent feelings.
Therefore, 'she' in this context refers to Diana, who hates Aruna and has become a drunk womanizer.",1,1
1870,"Earlier, actress Vidya Balan was chosen to play the role of Kamini, but reports suggested she refused and was subsequently replaced by Mallika Sherawat.",she,"0: Kamini, 1: actress Vidya Balan, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" refers to actress Vidya Balan. The sentence structure indicates that Vidya Balan was initially chosen for the role of Kamini, but then she (Vidya Balan) refused the role. The pronoun ""she"" is used to avoid repeating Vidya Balan's name in the second part of the sentence. It cannot refer to Kamini, as Kamini is the character being played, not the actress making the decision. Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" clearly refers to Vidya Balan.",0,1
1871,"Sophie does not love Fredericka, but she believes marrying her will be an acceptable way to end her dead-end existence in the boarding house.",she,"0: Sophie, 1: Fredericka, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""she"" the pronoun refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Sophie does not love Fredericka.""
2. Then it says ""but she believes...""

The pronoun ""she"" is more likely to refer to Sophie for the following reasons:
1. Sophie is the subject of the first clause, making her the more prominent character in the sentence.
2. The sentence is describing Sophie's feelings and thoughts about Fredericka and the potential marriage.
3. It would make more sense for Sophie to be the one considering marriage as a way to end her ""dead-end existence in the boarding house.""

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Sophie.",0,0
1872,Coline tries to revive Julia but she dies and her attacker unknown.,she,"0: Julia, 1: Coline, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Julia. The context suggests that Coline is trying to revive Julia, implying that Julia is in a critical condition. The phrase ""but she dies"" follows immediately after, indicating that the person Coline was trying to save (Julia) has died. It wouldn't make sense for ""she"" to refer to Coline in this context, as Coline is the one performing the action of trying to revive someone.",0,0
1873,Bobby Jay tries to outdraw Lomax but he can't and he is shot dead.,he,"0: Lomax, 1: Bobby Jay, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""he"" refers to: Lomax or Bobby Jay. Let's analyze the context:

1. Bobby Jay is trying to outdraw Lomax.
2. ""He can't"" - This ""he"" likely refers to Bobby Jay, as he's the one attempting to outdraw Lomax and failing.
3. ""He is shot dead"" - This ""he"" also likely refers to Bobby Jay, as it's the logical consequence of failing to outdraw someone in a gunfight.

Both instances of ""he"" in the sentence appear to refer to Bobby Jay. The sentence is describing Bobby Jay's actions and the consequences he faces. Lomax is only mentioned as the person Bobby Jay is trying to outdraw, but the pronouns don't seem to refer to him.",1,1
1874,"Ludwig von Pastor has shown that Pope Julius II was not illiterate, although he is poetically referred to as such by Desiderius Erasmus.",he,"0: Ludwig von Pastor, 1: Pope Julius II, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Pope Julius II. The context of the sentence is discussing Pope Julius II's literacy, and the pronoun ""he"" is used in reference to the subject of Erasmus' poetic description. Ludwig von Pastor is mentioned as the person who has shown information about Pope Julius II, but he is not the subject of the pronoun in this case.",0,1
1875,"Matilde continues to pursue Leonore, though she still wants her to leave, as she is attracted to her and afraid of breaking her priestly vows.",she,"0: Matilde, 1: Leonore, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Matilde continues to pursue Leonore""
2. Then it says ""though she still wants her to leave""
3. Finally, it states ""as she is attracted to her and afraid of breaking her priestly vows""

The pronoun ""she"" appears twice in this sentence. Let's break it down:

1. ""she still wants her to leave"" - This ""she"" likely refers to Matilde, as Matilde is the subject of the sentence and the one pursuing Leonore. It wouldn't make sense for Leonore to want herself to leave.

2. ""she is attracted to her"" - This ""she"" also refers to Matilde. The attraction and the fear of breaking priestly vows are reasons for Matilde's actions described earlier in the sentence.

Therefore, both instances of ""she"" in this sentence refer to Matilde.",1,0
1876,Alicia encourages Nathalie to fight back if anyone picks a fight with her.,her,"0: Alicia, 1: Nathalie, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""her"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence is about Alicia encouraging Nathalie.
2. The pronoun ""her"" is used at the end of the sentence in the phrase ""fight with her.""
3. Logically, Alicia is encouraging Nathalie to fight back if someone picks a fight with Nathalie, not with Alicia.
4. It wouldn't make sense for Alicia to encourage Nathalie to fight back if someone picks a fight with Alicia.

Therefore, the pronoun ""her"" most likely refers to Nathalie.",1,1
1877,"The school's principal Dora McKenzie is initially reluctant to hire Zoe Baldwin, because she has no degree.",she,"0: The school 's principal Dora McKenzie, 1: Zoe Baldwin, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and grammatical structure of the sentence.

1. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""because she has no degree.""
2. This clause provides a reason for the principal's reluctance to hire Zoe Baldwin.
3. Logically, the person without a degree would be the one being considered for hiring, not the principal.
4. It wouldn't make sense for the principal to be reluctant to hire someone because the principal herself has no degree.
5. Therefore, ""she"" must refer to Zoe Baldwin, as she is the one being considered for hiring and the one who likely lacks the degree.

The pronoun ""she"" cannot refer to ""The school"" as schools are typically referred to as ""it,"" not ""she."" Additionally, the context clearly indicates that we're discussing people, not the school itself.

Based on this reasoning, the pronoun ""she"" refers to Zoe Baldwin.",0,1
1878,"After Arakawa dies suddenly, Tomoko is at first relieved, but then discovers that she is incapable of enjoying sex unless she is in a masochistic position.",she,"0: Arakawa, 1: Tomoko, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" clearly refers to Tomoko. The sentence structure indicates that after Arakawa's death, Tomoko experiences a change in her sexual preferences. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the latter part of the sentence to describe Tomoko's discovery about her own sexual experiences. Arakawa is mentioned as having died, so the pronoun cannot refer to Arakawa. Therefore, the only logical referent for ""she"" is Tomoko.",0,1
1879,Amelia tackles Sophia but she is in turn pinned against the shed and has her spine torn out.,her,"0: Sophia, 1: Amelia, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. ""Amelia tackles Sophia"" - This establishes the initial action, with Amelia as the subject and Sophia as the object.

2. ""but she is in turn pinned against the shed"" - The use of ""but"" indicates a reversal of fortune. The pronoun ""she"" likely refers to the person who was previously in control of the situation, which was Amelia.

3. ""and has her spine torn out"" - This continues the description of what happens to the person who is pinned against the shed.

The pronoun ""her"" in this context refers to the same person as ""she"" in the previous clause. Since we've established that ""she"" most likely refers to Amelia, ""her"" would also refer to Amelia.

Therefore, the pronoun ""her"" in this sentence refers to Amelia.",0,1
1880,"When Mrs. Phelps asks what happens, Matilda does n't know, but will be back to tell her more.",her,"0: Mrs. Phelps, 1: Matilda, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who the pronoun ""her"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Mrs. Phelps is asking a question.
2. Matilda doesn't know the answer.
3. Matilda will be back to tell ""her"" more.

The pronoun ""her"" is used in the context of Matilda returning to tell someone more information. Given that Mrs. Phelps is the one asking the question, it makes sense that Matilda would return to tell Mrs. Phelps more information once she knows the answer.

Therefore, the pronoun ""her"" most likely refers to Mrs. Phelps.",1,0
1881,Amanda then decides to manipulate Hermione again when she finds out she has a crush on her friend Sarah Aquino.,she,"0: Amanda, 1: Hermione, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence starts with ""Amanda then decides to manipulate Hermione again...""
2. The pronoun ""she"" appears in the clause ""...when she finds out she has a crush on her friend Sarah Aquino.""

Given this context, it's more likely that ""she"" refers to Hermione for the following reasons:

1. The sentence is about Amanda manipulating Hermione, which suggests that Amanda is acting based on information about Hermione.
2. It's more logical that Amanda would manipulate Hermione based on Hermione's crush, rather than Amanda's own crush.
3. The phrase ""her friend Sarah Aquino"" is more likely to refer to Hermione's friend, as it's presented as new information that Amanda discovers about Hermione.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" in this context most likely refers to Hermione.",0,1
1882,"Ava tries to pursue Mia, although she plays hard to get.",she,"0: Ava, 1: Mia, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Ava is the subject of the sentence and is actively pursuing Mia.
2. Mia is the object of Ava's pursuit.
3. The pronoun ""she"" is described as playing ""hard to get.""

Playing ""hard to get"" is typically associated with the person being pursued, not the pursuer. In this case, Mia is the one being pursued by Ava. Therefore, it makes more sense for ""she"" to refer to Mia, who is playing hard to get in response to Ava's pursuit.",1,1
1883,Normann wrote to Munch asking if he would exhibit his work in Berlin.,he,"0: Normann, 1: Munch, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Munch. The context suggests that Normann is the one who wrote to Munch, asking if Munch would exhibit his (Munch's) work in Berlin. It wouldn't make sense for Normann to ask if Normann would exhibit his own work, as he's the one doing the asking. Therefore, ""he"" in this context refers to Munch, who is being asked to exhibit his work.",0,1
1884,"Daniela also begins falling for Elena, although she continues her relationship with Stefan.",she,"0: Daniela, 1: Elena, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" refers to Daniela for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure indicates that ""she"" is the subject of the clause ""she continues her relationship with Stefan.""
2. Daniela is mentioned first in the sentence and is the main subject of the entire statement.
3. The context suggests that Daniela is the one who is falling for Elena while maintaining a relationship with Stefan.
4. It would not make sense for Elena to be continuing a relationship with Stefan in this context.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Daniela.",1,0
1885,"Caroline is then on the ground with Daniela after she has been killed, screaming for help and crying endlessly.",she,"0: Caroline, 1: Daniela, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence describes a scene where Caroline is on the ground with Daniela.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the phrase ""after she has been killed.""
3. The sentence then mentions ""screaming for help and crying endlessly.""

Given this information, we can deduce:
- Caroline is described as being alive, as she is screaming for help and crying.
- The phrase ""after she has been killed"" implies that someone has died.
- Since Caroline is clearly alive, the person who has been killed must be Daniela.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" in this context refers to Daniela, as she is the one who has been killed.",1,1
1886,"Janis is ordered to kill Noelia, but does n't know if she can go along with this.",she,"0: Janis, 1: Noelia, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Janis for the following reasons:

1. Janis is the subject of the sentence and the main focus of the action.
2. The sentence structure suggests that ""she"" is referring to the person who is being ordered and who is considering whether to follow through with the order.
3. It would make less sense for ""she"" to refer to Noelia, as Noelia is the object of the action (the person to be killed) rather than the one making a decision.
4. The phrase ""doesn't know if she can go along with this"" implies an internal conflict, which aligns with Janis's position as the one being ordered to kill.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Janis.",0,0
1887,"Ava calls Serena immediately after, only to find out that she and Blair are on their way to Paris.",she,"0: Ava, 1: Serena, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. Ava calls Serena immediately after something (not specified in this sentence).
2. Ava finds out some information during this call.
3. The information is that ""she and Blair are on their way to Paris.""

The pronoun ""she"" in this context is most likely referring to Serena for the following reasons:
- Serena is the person Ava is calling, so she's the main subject of the conversation.
- It would be unusual for Ava to refer to herself in the third person when relaying information she just found out.
- The sentence structure suggests that ""she and Blair"" are together, and since Ava is the one making the call, it's more logical that Serena is the one with Blair.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Serena.",1,1
1888,"Later, Elizabeth tries to call Emma, but she does n't answer her phone.",she,"0: Emma, 1: Elizabeth, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Elizabeth is the subject of the sentence, performing the action of trying to call Emma.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""she doesn't answer her phone.""
3. Logically, the person not answering the phone would be the one being called, which is Emma.

Therefore, ""she"" in this context refers to Emma, as Emma is the one who is not answering her phone when Elizabeth tries to call her.",0,0
1889,Emma had searched for Moza everywhere but she still could not find her for a while.,she,"0: Emma, 1: Moza, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Emma. The reasoning is as follows:

1. Emma is the subject of the sentence and the main actor performing the action (searching).
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the same clause as the action of not being able to find Moza.
3. It would be illogical for ""she"" to refer to Moza in this context, as Moza is the object being searched for.
4. The sentence structure suggests that Emma is the one who ""still could not find her,"" with ""her"" referring to Moza.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" in this sentence is most likely referring to Emma.",0,0
1890,"Anne makes a deal with Georgiana, that she keep quiet about the arrest if she can work on the statue for one week.",she,"0: Anne, 1: Georgiana, 2: Neither","In this sentence, there are two instances of the pronoun ""she"". Let's analyze each:

1. ""...that she keep quiet about the arrest"": This ""she"" refers to Georgiana. Anne is making a deal with Georgiana, asking her to keep quiet.

2. ""...if she can work on the statue"": This ""she"" refers to Anne. Anne is requesting to work on the statue in exchange for Georgiana's silence.

Since the question doesn't specify which ""she"" we're focusing on, and both Anne and Georgiana are referred to by ""she"" in this sentence, we can't definitively choose between them. Therefore, the correct answer is 2 (Neither), as we can't determine a single referent for ""she"" in this context.",1,2
1891,"Juliette plans to kill Rosalie, because she knows they stole the painting, Louis tries to protect her by advising her to escape.",she,"0: Juliette, 1: Rosalie, 2: Neither","In this sentence, there are two instances of the pronoun ""she"" that we need to consider:

1. ""she knows they stole the painting""
2. ""Louis tries to protect her""

For the first instance, ""she"" clearly refers to Juliette because it's stated that Juliette plans to kill Rosalie because of this knowledge.

For the second instance, ""her"" also refers to Juliette because Louis is trying to protect the person who is planning to kill Rosalie, which is Juliette.

Therefore, both instances of ""she/her"" in this sentence refer to Juliette.",1,0
1892,"Ritta leaves the house to find Mitzeee but, when she finds her, she is accidentally shot by Simon Walker.",she,"0: Ritta, 1: Mitzeee, 2: Neither","In this sentence, there are two instances of 'she'. The first 'she' clearly refers to Ritta, as it's stated that 'Ritta leaves the house to find Mitzeee but, when she finds her...'. This 'she' is the subject performing the action of finding. However, the second 'she' in '...she is accidentally shot by Simon Walker' is ambiguous. It could refer to either Ritta or Mitzeee, as the sentence structure doesn't clearly indicate which woman was shot. Given this ambiguity, we cannot definitively determine which of the two candidates the pronoun 'she' refers to in this context.",0,2
1893,"Brenda spends a day with Jasmine, but she runs off after she kisses her.",she,"0: Brenda, 1: Jasmine, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""she"" refers to Brenda or Jasmine. The sentence structure suggests that one person initiates a kiss, and then someone runs off. Given the context, it's more likely that one person (the initiator of the kiss) would run off after kissing the other, rather than the person being kissed running away.

The sentence starts with ""Brenda spends a day with Jasmine,"" which sets up Brenda as the primary subject. Then it says ""but she runs off after she kisses her."" This structure implies that the first ""she"" (the one who runs off) is the same person as the second ""she"" (the one who initiates the kiss).

Given this interpretation, it's more likely that Brenda is the one who kisses Jasmine and then runs off. Therefore, both instances of ""she"" in the sentence likely refer to Brenda.",1,0
1894,"Alicia supports Brenda, but is dismayed when she and Andy have sex to conceive the baby.",she,"0: Alicia, 1: Brenda, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, let's analyze the sentence:

1. The sentence starts with ""Alicia supports Brenda,"" establishing both Alicia and Brenda as potential referents for ""she.""

2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""when she and Andy have sex to conceive the baby.""

3. The action of having sex with Andy to conceive a baby is more likely to be associated with Brenda rather than Alicia. This is because:
   a) Alicia is described as supporting Brenda, suggesting Brenda is the one trying to have a baby.
   b) Alicia is ""dismayed"" by this action, indicating she is not the one involved in it.

4. The context implies that Brenda is likely the one trying to conceive a baby, with Alicia supporting her but being upset about the method.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Brenda.",1,1
1895,"Marcia initially refuses to acknowledge Kim, but she eventually goes to see her.",she,"0: Marcia, 1: Kim, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Marcia initially refuses to acknowledge Kim.""
2. Then it says ""but she eventually goes to see her.""

The pronoun ""she"" is more likely to refer to Marcia because:
1. Marcia is the subject of the first part of the sentence, making her the more prominent actor.
2. The action of ""going to see her"" implies a change in Marcia's initial refusal to acknowledge Kim.
3. It would be grammatically awkward and confusing if ""she"" referred to Kim in this context.

Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Marcia.",0,0
1896,"Indi becomes concerned for Melanie, when she learns she has had an accident.",she,"0: Indi, 1: Melanie, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""she"" the pronoun refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Indi becomes concerned for Melanie.""
2. Then it continues with ""when she learns she has had an accident.""

The first ""she"" in the latter part of the sentence is the subject who learns about the accident. This is most likely referring to Indi, as she is the one becoming concerned.

The second ""she"" refers to the person who had the accident. This is clearly Melanie, as that's the reason for Indi's concern.

Since the question asks about the pronoun ""she"" without specifying which one, and the first ""she"" in the sentence is the one we encounter, we should consider that as our target pronoun. Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" in this case refers to Indi.",0,0
1897,Sonya asks Angie to leave when she catches her going through her bag looking for drugs.,she,"0: Sonya, 1: Angie, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun 'she' refers to Sonya. The context suggests that Sonya is the one who catches Angie going through her bag and subsequently asks Angie to leave. The pronoun 'she' is used as the subject of the action 'catches', which logically refers to Sonya, as she is the one discovering Angie's actions and reacting to them.",0,0
1898,Raphaela likes Sterre but she's to shy to express her feelings about her.,she,"0: Raphaela, 1: Sterre, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Raphaela for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure suggests that Raphaela is the main subject and the one with feelings for Sterre.
2. The phrase ""she's too shy to express her feelings"" implies that the person being referred to has feelings for someone else, which aligns with the first part of the sentence stating ""Raphaela likes Sterre.""
3. It's more common in language structure for the subject of the first clause (Raphaela) to be the subject of the following clause, especially when describing a characteristic or action of that person.

Therefore, ""she"" in this context is most likely referring to Raphaela, who is too shy to express her feelings about Sterre.",0,0
1899,Elaine stayed at the hospital with Anne until she was released and after she left she invited her back to stop at her house for a while.,she,"0: Elaine, 1: Anne, 2: Neither","Let's analyze the sentence step by step:

1. ""Elaine stayed at the hospital with Anne until she was released""
   - This ""she"" likely refers to Anne, as patients are typically the ones released from hospitals.

2. ""and after she left""
   - This ""she"" could refer to either Elaine or Anne, as both could leave the hospital.

3. ""she invited her back to stop at her house for a while""
   - This ""she"" is more likely to be Elaine, as inviting someone to one's house is typically done by the host (Elaine) rather than the guest (Anne).

The pronoun ""she"" appears multiple times in the sentence, and it doesn't consistently refer to the same person. The first instance likely refers to Anne, while the last instance likely refers to Elaine. Given this ambiguity and the fact that the pronoun refers to different people in different parts of the sentence, we cannot definitively assign it to either Elaine or Anne for the entire sentence.",1,"2

1900,Jake fears Mary only because she seems to have more power than him.,she,"0: Jake, 1: Mary, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" clearly refers to Mary. The sentence structure indicates that Jake fears Mary, and the reason for this fear is explained using ""she."" Since ""she"" is used to describe the person with more power, and Mary is the one being feared, it logically follows that ""she"" refers to Mary.

The pronoun ""she"" cannot refer to Jake because Jake is male and would be referred to as ""he."" It also cannot refer to neither, as there are only two people mentioned in the sentence, and ""she"" clearly refers to one of them.",1,1
1901,"Georgiana is pressured to have sex with Eva, but she becomes uncomfortable and drives her away with her awkward and bizarre behavior.",she,"0: Georgiana, 1: Eva, 2: Neither","In this sentence, there are two instances of the pronoun ""she"". Let's analyze each:

1. ""...but she becomes uncomfortable"": This ""she"" clearly refers to Georgiana. The sentence indicates that Georgiana is the one being pressured and subsequently becoming uncomfortable.

2. ""...drives her away with her awkward and bizarre behavior"": The first ""her"" refers to Eva (being driven away), while the second ""her"" refers back to Georgiana (whose behavior is described as awkward and bizarre).

Given that the question asks about ""she"" without specifying which instance, and that both instances of ""she"" in the sentence refer to Georgiana, the correct answer is Georgiana.",0,0
1902,Peggy later treats Nicola's sister-in-law Steph Parker when she goes into cardiac arrest.,she,"0: Peggy, 1: Nicola 's sister-in-law Steph Parker, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions three people: Peggy, Nicola, and Steph Parker (Nicola's sister-in-law).
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""when she goes into cardiac arrest.""
3. The main action of the sentence is that Peggy treats someone.
4. It wouldn't make sense for Peggy to treat herself, so ""she"" is not referring to Peggy.
5. The person being treated is explicitly stated as ""Nicola's sister-in-law Steph Parker.""
6. Therefore, ""she"" must be referring to Steph Parker, who is the one going into cardiac arrest and being treated by Peggy.

Based on this analysis, the pronoun ""she"" refers to candidate 1: Nicola's sister-in-law Steph Parker.",1,1
1903,Peggy treats Bridget Parker again after she is injured in a car accident.,she,"0: Peggy, 1: Bridget Parker, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, let's analyze the sentence:

""Peggy treats Bridget Parker again after she is injured in a car accident.""

The pronoun ""she"" in this sentence refers to the person who is injured in a car accident. The sentence structure implies that Peggy is treating someone who has been injured, rather than being the injured party herself. Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Bridget Parker, who is the patient being treated by Peggy.

The use of ""again"" also suggests that this is a repeated occurrence, with Peggy treating Bridget Parker on multiple occasions. This further supports the interpretation that Bridget Parker is the one who has been injured and is being treated.",0,1
1904,Johanna becomes worried about Bridget when she stops attending her sessions and she tells her that has given up.,she,"0: Johanna, 1: Bridget, 2: Neither","In this sentence, there are multiple instances of 'she' and 'her', making it ambiguous which one we're specifically referring to. However, based on the context:

1. 'she stops attending her sessions' - This 'she' likely refers to Bridget, as Johanna is the one worried about Bridget's absence.
2. 'she tells her' - This 'she' is more likely to be Johanna, as she's the one who became worried and would be the one to express concern.
3. 'has given up' - This could refer to Bridget giving up on attending sessions.

Without more specific information about which 'she' we're asked to identify, we can't determine a single correct answer. The pronoun 'she' is used to refer to both Johanna and Bridget at different points in the sentence.",1,2
1905,"Sophie tried to seduce Adelita, but she sees her as lacking sufficient sophistication for her tastes.",she,"0: Sophie, 1: Adelita, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Sophie tried to seduce Adelita.""
2. The second part of the sentence uses ""she"" and ""her"" pronouns.
3. The key phrase is ""she sees her as lacking sufficient sophistication for her tastes.""

Given this information:
- ""She"" is the subject who is doing the seeing and judging.
- ""Her"" (first occurrence) refers to the person being seen or judged.
- ""Her tastes"" refers back to the subject who is doing the judging.

It's more logical that the person doing the judging (finding the other lacking in sophistication) would be Sophie, as she was the one attempting to seduce Adelita. It's unlikely that Adelita would be judging Sophie as lacking sophistication in this context.

Therefore, ""she"" in this sentence most likely refers to Sophie.",1,0
1906,Lara almost connects with Sharon when she is interrupted by Tony and Sonya.,she,"0: Lara, 1: Sharon, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Lara almost connects with Sharon...""
2. This is followed by ""when she is interrupted...""

The pronoun ""she"" is more likely to refer to Lara for the following reasons:
- Lara is the subject of the main clause and is performing the action of ""almost connecting"" with Sharon.
- It's more natural for the subject of the main clause (Lara) to continue being the focus in the subordinate clause.
- The interruption is happening to the person who was trying to connect, which is Lara.

While it's not impossible for ""she"" to refer to Sharon, it's less likely given the sentence structure and the flow of the action described.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Lara.",0,0
1907,"Kandi tries getting back together with Wendy, but she refuses due to her relationship with Lyndsey.",she,"0: Kandi, 1: Wendy, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" is used to refer to Wendy. We can determine this because:

1. The sentence structure indicates that Kandi is the subject who is trying to get back together with Wendy.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""she refuses,"" which describes the action taken by the person Kandi is trying to get back together with.
3. The reason for the refusal is given as ""due to her relationship with Lyndsey,"" which further confirms that ""she"" refers to Wendy, as Wendy is the one in a relationship with Lyndsey.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" in this context refers to Wendy.",1,1
1908,Bridget later comes wanting Ludivine back but she declines her wanting Zoey instead.,she,"0: Bridget, 1: Ludivine, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Bridget later comes wanting Ludivine back""
2. Then it continues with ""but she declines her""
3. Finally, it ends with ""wanting Zoey instead""

The pronoun ""she"" is used in the context of declining someone. In this case, it's logical that Ludivine is declining Bridget's desire to have her back. Bridget is the one who comes wanting Ludivine, and Ludivine is the one who declines.

Therefore, ""she"" in this context refers to Ludivine, not Bridget.",1,1
1909,"Celeste shows to be controlling over Jake, but he does n't seem to notice.",he,"0: Celeste, 1: Jake, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" clearly refers to Jake. The sentence structure indicates that Celeste is the subject performing an action (showing controlling behavior), while Jake is the object of this action. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the second part of the sentence to refer back to Jake, stating that he doesn't seem to notice Celeste's controlling behavior. The use of ""he"" is consistent with Jake being male, while Celeste is typically a female name.",1,1
1910,Meagher sought an apprehended violence order against Chloe when she used colourful language to describe her intention to defeat her.,she,"0: Meagher, 1: Chloe, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Meagher sought an apprehended violence order against Chloe.""
2. This is followed by ""when she used colourful language...""

The pronoun ""she"" is more likely to refer to Chloe for the following reasons:
1. Chloe is the object of the first clause and the most recently mentioned person before the pronoun appears.
2. The action of using ""colourful language"" to describe an intention to defeat someone is more likely to be the reason for seeking an apprehended violence order against that person.
3. It would be unusual for Meagher to seek an order against Chloe because of Meagher's own actions.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Chloe.",0,1
1911,Bree is rollerskating with Katie when she gets hot and dizzy out of nowhere and falls off her skates.,she,"0: Bree, 1: Katie, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Bree for the following reasons:

1. Bree is mentioned first in the sentence, making her the primary subject.
2. The sentence describes someone getting hot and dizzy, which is more likely to happen to the person who is actively rollerskating (Bree) rather than someone who is just with her (Katie).
3. The phrase ""falls off her skates"" implies that the person referred to by ""she"" is the one wearing the skates, which is consistent with Bree being the one rollerskating.

While Katie is mentioned in the sentence, she appears to be a secondary character who is accompanying Bree rather than the one experiencing the described events.",0,0
1912,"When hearing Sujie had been strangled, Shangjin was so afraid that he hanged himself.",he,"0: Shangjin, 1: Sujie, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" clearly refers to Shangjin. The sentence structure indicates that upon hearing about Sujie's strangulation, Shangjin reacted by hanging himself. The pronoun ""he"" is used to describe the action of hanging, which is attributed to Shangjin's fear response to the news about Sujie. Sujie is mentioned as the victim of strangulation, not the one who hanged himself. Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" must refer to Shangjin.",0,0
1913,"Karen threatens Emma that if she does n't pay her some child support, ` the popo's gon' be knockin' at yo' do'!",she,"0: Karen, 1: Emma, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. Karen is the subject of the sentence, performing the action of threatening.
2. Emma is the object of the threat.
3. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the conditional clause ""if she doesn't pay her some child support.""

Given this context, it's more likely that ""she"" refers to Emma because:
1. Emma is the one being threatened, so it makes sense that she would be the one expected to pay child support.
2. It's unlikely that Karen would threaten Emma about Karen's own failure to pay child support.
3. The structure of the sentence suggests that ""she"" refers to the person being threatened (Emma) rather than the person making the threat (Karen).

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Emma.",1,1
1914,"Amanda pretends to let Alexandra go so she can pursue a new life, warning her to stay away from Nikita.",she,"0: Amanda, 1: Alexandra, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Amanda is the subject of the first part of the sentence, performing the action of pretending to let Alexandra go.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""so she can pursue a new life.""
3. The action of pursuing a new life is more likely to be associated with Alexandra, who is being let go, rather than Amanda, who is doing the letting go.
4. The final part of the sentence, ""warning her to stay away from Nikita,"" further supports that Alexandra is the one being referred to, as she is the one being warned.

Based on this analysis, it's clear that ""she"" refers to Alexandra, not Amanda. Alexandra is the one who is being allowed to pursue a new life and being warned to stay away from Nikita.",0,1
1915,"Ekaterina Kramarenko was called in to replace Komova, but she withdrew shortly after because of illness.",she,"0: Komova, 1: Ekaterina Kramarenko, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Ekaterina Kramarenko was called in to replace Komova.
2. ""She"" withdrew shortly after because of illness.

The pronoun ""she"" is more likely to refer to Ekaterina Kramarenko for the following reasons:
1. Ekaterina Kramarenko is the main subject of the sentence.
2. The action of withdrawing is directly connected to Ekaterina Kramarenko's involvement as a replacement.
3. It would be illogical for Komova to withdraw since she was already replaced.

Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Ekaterina Kramarenko.",0,1
1916,"Kate tries to drag Helene, but she eventually has to save her own life.",her,"0: Kate, 1: Helene, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""her"" refers to. The context suggests that Kate is trying to drag Helene, but then has to save ""her own life."" The phrase ""her own life"" indicates that ""her"" is referring to Kate, as she is the one who has to save herself. It wouldn't make sense for Kate to be saving Helene's life in this context, especially after trying to drag her. Therefore, ""her"" in this sentence refers to Kate.",0,0
1917,Saikumar was initially approached to the enact the character of Bharatha but he was eventually replaced by Sameer.,he,"0: Saikumar, 1: Bharatha, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Saikumar was initially approached to enact the character of Bharatha.
2. But ""he"" was eventually replaced by Sameer.

The pronoun ""he"" in this context refers to the person who was initially approached and then replaced. This person is Saikumar. 

Bharatha is mentioned as a character to be enacted, not as a person who was approached or replaced. Therefore, ""he"" cannot refer to Bharatha.

The pronoun clearly refers to a specific person mentioned in the text, so the ""Neither"" option is not applicable.

Based on this reasoning, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Saikumar.",0,0
1918,Veronica tries to flirt with Kate but she tells her she is married.,she,"0: Veronica, 1: Kate, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""she"" the pronoun refers to. Let's break it down:

1. Veronica is trying to flirt with Kate.
2. ""She"" tells ""her"" that ""she"" is married.

The most logical interpretation is that Kate is the one who is married and is telling Veronica this information. This makes sense because:

1. If Veronica was already married, she likely wouldn't be flirting with Kate.
2. The sentence structure suggests that Kate is responding to Veronica's flirtation by informing her of her marital status.

Therefore, the first ""she"" in the sentence most likely refers to Kate, who is telling Veronica (her) that she (Kate) is married.",1,1
1919,"Mitta develops feelings for Amy, but she does n't notice her attentions.",she,"0: Mitta, 1: Amy, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Mitta develops feelings for Amy.
2. ""she"" doesn't notice her attentions.

The pronoun ""she"" is more likely to refer to Amy because:
- Mitta is the one developing feelings, so Mitta is aware of her own attentions.
- The sentence implies that someone is not noticing these attentions, which logically would be Amy.
- It's more natural to use ""she"" to refer to the most recently mentioned person (Amy) rather than the subject of the sentence (Mitta).

Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Amy in this context.",1,1
1920,"Michaela is not happy to see Emilia, but she allows her to stay for Natasha's sake.",she,"0: Michaela, 1: Emilia, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Michaela is not happy to see Emilia.
2. ""She"" allows ""her"" to stay.
3. This is done for Natasha's sake.

Given this information, we can deduce that:
- Michaela is the subject of the first clause and is described as not being happy.
- ""She"" in the second clause is allowing someone to stay.
- ""Her"" likely refers to Emilia, as she's the one being seen (and potentially allowed to stay).

Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Michaela. Michaela is the one who, despite not being happy to see Emilia, is allowing Emilia to stay for Natasha's sake. This interpretation maintains the logical flow of the sentence and aligns with the typical structure where the subject of the first clause (Michaela) continues as the subject (she) in the second clause.",0,0
1921,"Elaine asks to spend Easter with Anna, but she comes up with an excuse as to why she can not.",she,"0: Elaine, 1: Anna, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Anna. The context suggests that Elaine is the one asking to spend Easter with Anna, and then ""she"" (referring to Anna) comes up with an excuse as to why she cannot. This interpretation makes the most sense because:

1. Elaine is the one initiating the request to spend Easter together.
2. It would be unusual for Elaine to come up with an excuse immediately after making the request herself.
3. The natural flow of the sentence implies that Anna is the one responding to Elaine's request with an excuse.

Therefore, ""she"" in this context is most likely referring to Anna, who is providing the excuse for why she cannot spend Easter with Elaine.",1,1
1922,"Sandrine had voted for Marine, so she was asked to vote again.",she,"0: Marine, 1: Sandrine, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Sandrine. The sentence structure suggests that Sandrine is the main subject who performed the action of voting, and then was asked to do something as a result. The pronoun ""she"" is used to continue referring to Sandrine in the second part of the sentence. Marine is mentioned as the person Sandrine voted for, but is not the subject of the sentence or the one being asked to vote again.",0,1
1923,"Julia demands to know why Joelle left, and she admits that after the attack she became a monster and that she did not want to hurt her.",she,"0: Julia, 1: Joelle, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""she"" refers to. Let's break it down:

1. Julia demands to know why Joelle left
2. ""she"" admits that after the attack she became a monster
3. ""she"" did not want to hurt ""her""

The key here is understanding who became a monster and who might be hurt. Given that Julia is demanding to know why Joelle left, it's more likely that Joelle is the one who left after becoming a ""monster"". The pronoun ""she"" in this context refers to Joelle, who is admitting her transformation and expressing that she didn't want to hurt Julia.

The use of ""her"" at the end of the sentence also supports this interpretation, as it likely refers to Julia (the person who might be hurt by Joelle's actions).

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" in this context refers to Joelle.",1,1
1924,"Carole used to work for Stella Price, until she was caught flirting with her then partner, Karl Munro.",she,"0: Carole, 1: Stella Price, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Carole used to work for Stella Price.""
2. The pronoun ""she"" appears in the clause ""until she was caught flirting.""
3. The sentence implies that the person who was caught flirting was the employee, not the employer.
4. It's more logical that an employee would be caught flirting with their employer's partner, rather than the employer flirting with their own partner.

Based on these points, it's clear that ""she"" refers to Carole, who was the employee caught flirting with Stella Price's partner, Karl Munro. The pronoun ""she"" is used to avoid repeating Carole's name in the second part of the sentence.",0,0
1925,"Thomas Zouch was best known as an editor and biographer of Izaak Walton, though his biography of Walton would be superseded by that of Nicholas Harris Nicolas.",his,"0: Thomas Zouch, 1: Izaak Walton, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""his"" refers to Thomas Zouch. The sentence is discussing Thomas Zouch's work as a biographer of Izaak Walton. The phrase ""his biography of Walton"" indicates that Thomas Zouch wrote a biography about Izaak Walton. Therefore, the pronoun ""his"" is referring to Thomas Zouch's work.",1,0
1926,Sophie is angry with Beatrice at first but she admits she has put too much pressure on her.,she,"0: Sophie, 1: Beatrice, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""she"" refers to Sophie or Beatrice. Let's break it down:

1. The sentence starts with ""Sophie is angry with Beatrice at first""
2. Then it continues with ""but she admits""

The pronoun ""she"" in this context is more likely to refer to Sophie because:

1. Sophie is the subject of the first part of the sentence, making her the more prominent actor.
2. The sentence structure suggests a change in Sophie's attitude (from being angry to admitting something), which is more logically connected to Sophie than Beatrice.
3. It would be less common for the sentence to suddenly switch to Beatrice's perspective without explicitly mentioning her name again.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Sophie in this context.",0,0
1927,"Nicole tries to discover more about Marly, but she is at first unforthcoming.",she,"0: Nicole, 1: Marly, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Marly. The context suggests that Nicole is trying to discover more about Marly, and then the sentence states that ""she is at first unforthcoming."" It makes more sense that Marly would be the one who is unforthcoming, as Nicole is the one seeking information. If Nicole were unforthcoming, it wouldn't align with her action of trying to discover more about Marly.",1,1
1928,Cilla throws Lea out after she admits to having sex with Janice.,she,"0: Cilla, 1: Lea, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Cilla throws Lea out""
2. This is followed by ""after she admits to having sex with Janice""

The pronoun ""she"" is more likely to refer to Lea because:
1. Lea is the object of the first clause and the subject of the second clause.
2. It makes more logical sense that Cilla would throw Lea out after Lea admits to having sex with Janice, rather than Cilla admitting it herself.
3. The pronoun ""she"" is closer to Lea in the sentence structure, which is often (but not always) an indicator of the pronoun's referent.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Lea.",1,1
1929,"When Tahnee realises that Emma can not read or write, she begins to blackmail her.",she,"0: Tahnee, 1: Emma, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""she"" refers to: Tahnee or Emma. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence starts with ""When Tahnee realises...""
2. Then it mentions ""...that Emma can not read or write...""
3. The pronoun ""she"" appears in the clause ""she begins to blackmail her.""

Given this structure, it's clear that ""she"" refers to Tahnee for the following reasons:
1. Tahnee is the subject of the first part of the sentence, making her the more likely antecedent for ""she.""
2. The action of blackmailing is being done to ""her,"" which logically refers to Emma (the one who can't read or write).
3. It makes more sense in the context that Tahnee would blackmail Emma based on the information about Emma's inability to read or write, rather than the other way around.

Therefore, ""she"" in this sentence refers to Tahnee.",0,0
1930,Lynette calls Emma to find out when she will be home and discovers that she has to fly to Montreal on the private jet for a meeting.,she,"0: Lynette, 1: Emma, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence starts with ""Lynette calls Emma,"" establishing these two individuals as the main subjects.
2. The first ""she"" in ""when she will be home"" is ambiguous, as it could refer to either Lynette or Emma.
3. The second ""she"" in ""she has to fly to Montreal"" provides more context. It's more likely that Emma is the one who has to fly to Montreal for a meeting, as Lynette is the one making the call to find out about Emma's plans.
4. The use of ""discovers"" implies that Lynette is learning new information about Emma's plans, further supporting that Emma is the one who has to fly to Montreal.

Given this analysis, it's more logical to conclude that ""she"" refers to Emma in this context.",1,1
1931,"Henry was thus forced to enter the war against Philip II, even though he considered negotiating peace with Spain several times.",he,"0: Henry, 1: Philip II, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Henry for the following reasons:

1. Henry is the subject of the main clause and is mentioned first in the sentence, making him the most prominent entity.

2. The sentence structure suggests that Henry is the one who was forced to enter the war and who considered negotiating peace. This aligns with the actions attributed to the pronoun ""he.""

3. It would be less logical for Philip II to consider negotiating peace with Spain, as he was the King of Spain during this period.

4. The sentence is primarily about Henry's actions and decisions, with Philip II mentioned only as the opponent in the war.

Therefore, based on the context and sentence structure, ""he"" most likely refers to Henry.",0,0
1932,"Mother is offered the chance to be with Emilie but in the end, she decides to stay with her husband.",she,"0: Mother, 1: Baba, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" clearly refers to ""Mother"" for the following reasons:

1. ""Mother"" is the subject of the first part of the sentence and is the main focus.
2. The sentence describes a decision made by ""she,"" which logically follows from the initial mention of ""Mother"" being offered a choice.
3. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the context of making a decision to stay with ""her husband,"" which implies that ""she"" is the wife, i.e., ""Mother.""
4. There is no mention of ""Baba"" in the given text, so ""Baba"" cannot be the referent of ""she.""

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" unambiguously refers to ""Mother"" in this context.",1,0
1933,"Ava is called in to question Tina, but she still refuses to talk, comparing her relationship with Sean to that of Bonnie and Clyde.",she,"0: Ava, 1: Tina, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Tina for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""she"" is the subject of the second clause, which is contrasting with the first clause.
2. Ava is the one doing the questioning, so it wouldn't make sense for her to refuse to talk.
3. The comparison to Bonnie and Clyde implies that ""she"" (Tina) is in a relationship with Sean, and is refusing to betray or speak against him.
4. It's more logical for the person being questioned (Tina) to refuse to talk, rather than the person doing the questioning (Ava).

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Tina.",1,1
1934,"Indi asks Mink to stay, but she departs, leaving a note for Romeo.",she,"0: Indi, 1: Mink, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" refers to Mink. We can determine this because:

1. The sentence structure indicates that Indi is asking Mink to stay.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is then used to describe the action of departing.
3. It would not make sense for Indi to ask Mink to stay and then depart herself.
4. The action of leaving a note for Romeo further supports that it is Mink who is departing, as she would be the one to leave a note if she were leaving.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most logically refers to Mink.",0,1
1935,Sandra suggested that Tania was a suspect because her husband was Catholic.,her,"0: Sandra, 1: Tania, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""her"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. Sandra is the subject of the main clause.
2. Tania is mentioned as a suspect.
3. The pronoun ""her"" is used in relation to a husband.

The sentence structure suggests that ""her"" is more likely to refer to Tania rather than Sandra. This is because:

1. The information about the husband is presented as additional information about why Tania was considered a suspect.
2. It's more natural to provide information about the suspect (Tania) rather than the person making the suggestion (Sandra).
3. The pronoun ""her"" is closer to Tania in the sentence, which often indicates a stronger connection.

Therefore, based on the context and sentence structure, it's most likely that ""her"" refers to Tania.",1,1
1936,"Silvia is tricked into believing that Justine is dead, and so she is forced to marry Rafael.",she,"0: Silvia, 1: Justine, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""she"" refers to: Silvia or Justine. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Silvia is tricked into believing that Justine is dead.""
2. Then it continues with ""and so she is forced to marry Rafael.""

The pronoun ""she"" in this case refers to Silvia for the following reasons:
1. Silvia is the main subject of the sentence.
2. The phrase ""and so"" indicates a consequence of the previous statement, linking the action to Silvia.
3. It wouldn't make sense for Justine to be forced to marry Rafael if she is believed to be dead.

Therefore, ""she"" in this context refers to Silvia.",0,0
1937,"Ingrid is immediately attracted to Helene, but she turns her down.",she,"0: Ingrid, 1: Helene, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Ingrid is immediately attracted to Helene""
2. Then it continues with ""but she turns her down""

The pronoun ""she"" is used as the subject of the action ""turns her down."" In this context, it's more likely that the person doing the turning down is the one who was approached or propositioned, not the one who was initially attracted.

Ingrid is described as being attracted to Helene, which implies that Ingrid would be the one making an advance or showing interest. Therefore, ""she"" in this case most likely refers to Helene, who is turning down Ingrid's interest or advance.",1,1
1938,"Ingrid agrees to leave Helene alone for good if she sleeps with her just one time, she happily agrees.",she,"0: Ingrid, 1: Helene, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun 'she' is ambiguous and could refer to either Ingrid or Helene. However, based on the context and the structure of the sentence, it's more likely that 'she' refers to Helene. The sentence implies that Ingrid is making a proposition to Helene, and Helene is the one who 'happily agrees' to the condition. It wouldn't make sense for Ingrid to agree to her own proposition. Therefore, 'she' most likely refers to Helene.",1,1
1939,"Vicky repeatedly tires to seduce Emma, but she turns her down.",she,"0: Vicky, 1: Emma, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Vicky is trying to seduce Emma.
2. ""She"" is the subject of the action ""turns her down.""

Given this information, it's clear that ""she"" refers to Emma, not Vicky. Emma is the one who is turning down Vicky's attempts at seduction. If ""she"" referred to Vicky, the sentence wouldn't make sense, as Vicky is the one doing the seducing, not the turning down.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" refers to Emma, which is candidate 1.",1,1
1940,Diana Dors was originally cast as Gloria but turned down the role because she did not want to work with Joseph Janni.,she,"0: Gloria, 1: Diana Dors, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" clearly refers to Diana Dors. The sentence states that Diana Dors was originally cast as Gloria but turned down the role. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the latter part of the sentence to refer back to Diana Dors, indicating that it was Diana Dors who did not want to work with Joseph Janni. Gloria is mentioned as the character role, not as a person making a decision, so the pronoun cannot refer to Gloria. Therefore, the correct reference for ""she"" is Diana Dors.",0,1
1941,"Initially, Ellie refuses to speak with Nickita, though she is able to tell her that cheating on her has been the biggest mistake in his life.",she,"0: Nickita, 1: Ellie, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun 'she' is used twice. Let's analyze each occurrence:

1. 'she is able to tell her': Here, 'she' refers to Ellie, as Ellie is the one who is able to tell something to Nickita.
2. 'cheating on her': This 'her' likely refers to Nickita, as Ellie is telling Nickita that cheating on her (Nickita) was a mistake.

The question specifically asks about the pronoun 'she', which in this case clearly refers to Ellie. Ellie is the subject who is able to tell Nickita something, despite initially refusing to speak with her.",0,1
1942,Despite this Klitschko claims that Haye was unable to fight because he was just too good for him.,he,"0: Haye, 1: Klitschko, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Despite this Klitschko claims..."" indicating that Klitschko is making a statement.
2. The claim is about Haye being unable to fight.
3. The reason given is that ""he was just too good for him.""

Given this context, it's clear that Klitschko is claiming that he (Klitschko) was too good for Haye. The pronoun ""he"" in this case refers to Klitschko, as he is the one being described as ""too good"" in comparison to Haye.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Klitschko.",1,1
1943,"Mathilde loves Juliana, even though she is aware that she loves Madame de Renal.",she,"0: Mathilde, 1: Juliana, 2: Neither","In this sentence, there are two instances of 'she'. Let's analyze them separately:

1. The first 'she' in 'she is aware' likely refers to Mathilde. This is because Mathilde is the subject of the main clause and it's natural for the following pronoun to refer to her.

2. The second 'she' in 'she loves Madame de Renal' is more ambiguous. It could refer to either Mathilde or Juliana. However, given the context, it's more likely to refer to Juliana. The sentence structure suggests that Mathilde loves Juliana despite knowing about Juliana's love for Madame de Renal.

Since the question asks about 'she' without specifying which instance, and the two instances likely refer to different people, we cannot definitively choose between Mathilde and Juliana. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is 'Neither'.",0,2
1944,Later Bahadur Shah tried to capture Jaunpur but he was defeated by Mughal forces.,he,"0: Bahadur Shah, 1: Jaunpur, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" clearly refers to Bahadur Shah. The sentence structure indicates that Bahadur Shah is the subject who performed the action of trying to capture Jaunpur. The pronoun ""he"" is then used to refer back to Bahadur Shah when describing the outcome of his attempt (being defeated by Mughal forces). Jaunpur is the object of the capture attempt, not the subject, so it cannot be the referent of ""he"". Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" refers to candidate 0, Bahadur Shah.",1,0
1945,Daisy loves Missy but she only sees her as a friend.,she,"0: Daisy, 1: Missy, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Daisy loves Missy.""
2. Then it says ""but she only sees her as a friend.""

The pronoun ""she"" is more likely to refer to Daisy because:
1. Daisy is the subject of the first clause and is mentioned first.
2. The sentence structure implies that ""she"" (Daisy) sees ""her"" (Missy) as just a friend, despite loving her.
3. It would be less logical for Missy to see herself as just a friend.

Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Daisy in this context.",1,0
1946,Vinnie was relieved that Nicole had survived although she was in a coma.,she,"0: Vinnie, 1: Nicole, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, let's analyze the sentence:

""Vinnie was relieved that Nicole had survived although she was in a coma.""

1. The pronoun ""she"" is used to refer to a female person.
2. Both Vinnie and Nicole are likely female names, so both could potentially be referred to as ""she.""
3. The sentence structure suggests that the person who survived and is in a coma is the same person.
4. Vinnie is described as being relieved about Nicole's survival, indicating that Nicole is the one who survived.
5. The clause ""although she was in a coma"" is directly connected to the information about Nicole's survival.

Based on this analysis, it is most logical that ""she"" refers to Nicole, as Nicole is the one who survived and is in a coma.",1,1
1947,Marshal Breakenridge arrested Wallace but the court ruled he acted in self-defense.,he,"0: Wallace, 1: Marshal Breakenridge, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence mentions two individuals: Marshal Breakenridge and Wallace.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""he acted in self-defense.""
3. The court ruling is about the action of self-defense.
4. It's more logical that the person who was arrested (Wallace) would be the one claiming self-defense, rather than the person making the arrest (Marshal Breakenridge).

Therefore, it's most likely that ""he"" refers to Wallace, as Wallace would be the one who acted in self-defense, leading to the court's ruling.",0,0
1948,"Marine also later catches Sharon unconscious and when she comes round, she confronts her and throws her out.",she,"0: Marine, 1: Sharon, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""she"" refers to Marine or Sharon. Let's break it down:

1. The first ""she"" in ""when she comes round"" refers to Sharon, as Sharon is the one who was unconscious and is coming round.

2. The second ""she"" in ""she confronts her"" refers to Marine, as Marine is the one doing the confronting after Sharon comes round.

3. The third ""she"" in ""throws her out"" also refers to Marine, as it's a continuation of Marine's actions.

The pronoun we're specifically asked about is not specified, but since two out of three instances refer to Marine, and Marine is the more active subject in the sentence, it's more likely that an unspecified ""she"" would refer to Marine.",1,0
1949,Frey's parents were once picked up by US Border Patrol agents and deported because they were unable to convince them of their legal status.,they,"0: Frey 's parents, 1: US Border Patrol agents, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and grammatical structure of the sentence.

1. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the phrase ""they were unable to convince them of their legal status.""
2. This implies that ""they"" refers to the people who were trying to convince someone else about their legal status.
3. In the context of the sentence, Frey's parents are the ones who were picked up and deported because they couldn't convince the Border Patrol agents of their legal status.
4. The US Border Patrol agents are the ones who needed to be convinced, not the ones doing the convincing.

Therefore, ""they"" most likely refers to Frey's parents, as they are the subject of the action (trying to convince) and the ones affected by the deportation.",0,0
1950,"Natalia almost gets seduced by Sandra, but then throws her to her vampires.",her,"0: Natalia, 1: Sandra, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. ""Natalia almost gets seduced by Sandra"" - This establishes Natalia as the subject and Sandra as the one doing the seducing.

2. ""but then throws her to her vampires"" - This is where the pronoun ""her"" appears twice.

3. The first ""her"" in this phrase is the object being thrown. Given the context, it's more likely that Natalia is throwing Sandra, not herself.

4. The second ""her"" in ""her vampires"" is possessive. It's more logical that Natalia, as the main subject of the sentence, would be the one with vampires, rather than Sandra who was being seduced.

Therefore, both instances of ""her"" in this sentence most likely refer to Sandra. Natalia is the one doing the action (throwing), and Sandra is the one being acted upon (thrown).",1,1
1951,Jayne had been enraged at Joelle when she discovered what she had done.,she,"0: Jayne, 1: Joelle, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""she"" the pronoun refers to. The sentence structure suggests that ""she"" refers to Jayne for the following reasons:

1. Jayne is mentioned first in the sentence, making her the primary subject.
2. The sentence describes Jayne's emotional state (enraged) in reaction to something Joelle had done.
3. The first ""she"" in ""when she discovered"" is more likely to refer to Jayne, as it's describing the act of discovering something that caused the rage.
4. The second ""she"" in ""what she had done"" refers to Joelle, as it's the action that Jayne discovered and became enraged about.

Given this analysis, the pronoun ""she"" in question most likely refers to Jayne.",1,0
1952,Jayne had been enraged at Joelle when she discovered what she had done.,she,"0: Jayne, 1: Joelle, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""she"" the pronoun refers to. The sentence structure suggests that ""she"" refers to Jayne for the following reasons:

1. Jayne is mentioned first in the sentence, making her the primary subject.
2. The sentence describes Jayne's emotional state (enraged) in reaction to something Joelle had done.
3. The first ""she"" in ""when she discovered"" is more likely to refer to Jayne, as it's describing the act of discovering something that caused the rage.
4. The second ""she"" in ""what she had done"" refers to Joelle, as it's the action that Jayne discovered and became enraged about.

Given this analysis, the pronoun ""she"" in question most likely refers to Jayne.",1,0
1953,"Hermione attempts to stand up for Laura, but the tables are turned on her as everyone makes fun of her for not being able to draw.",her,"0: Hermione, 1: Laura, 2: Neither","In this sentence, there are two instances of the pronoun ""her"". We need to determine which one the question is referring to. Let's analyze both:

1. ""Hermione attempts to stand up for Laura, but the tables are turned on her...""
   In this first instance, ""her"" clearly refers to Hermione. The tables are turned on Hermione after she tries to stand up for Laura.

2. ""...as everyone makes fun of her for not being able to draw.""
   This second ""her"" is more ambiguous. It could refer to either Hermione or Laura, as we don't have enough context to determine which one can't draw.

Given that the question doesn't specify which ""her"" we're focusing on, and that both instances could potentially refer to either Hermione or Laura, we can't make a definitive choice between the two candidates. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is 2, indicating that we can't determine whether the pronoun refers to Hermione or Laura with certainty.",0,2
1954,Hermione is about to take Umbridge down when she grabs hold of her.,she,"0: Hermione, 1: Umbridge, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. The sentence structure suggests that ""she"" is the subject performing the action of grabbing. Given the context, it's more likely that Umbridge is the one grabbing Hermione, rather than Hermione grabbing herself. This interpretation aligns with the typical dynamic between these characters in the Harry Potter series, where Umbridge is often trying to assert control over students like Hermione. Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Umbridge.",1,1
1955,"Mattilda is willing to forgive Jenna, but she breaks up with her for Collin.",she,"0: Mattilda, 1: Jenna, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Mattilda is the subject of the first clause, ""Mattilda is willing to forgive Jenna.""
2. The second clause, ""but she breaks up with her for Collin,"" introduces an action that contrasts with the first clause.
3. The pronoun ""she"" is performing the action of breaking up with ""her.""
4. Given that Mattilda is forgiving Jenna in the first clause, it would be inconsistent for Mattilda to then break up with Jenna.
5. Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Jenna, who is breaking up with Mattilda for Collin.

The pronoun ""she"" refers to Jenna (candidate 1) in this context.",1,1
1956,Consequently Leah turns to Agathe when she needs to bring Kevin's wife Ellie to a hospital.,she,"0: Leah, 1: Agathe, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" refers to Leah. The sentence structure indicates that Leah is the subject who turns to Agathe for help. The pronoun ""she"" is used to avoid repeating Leah's name in the same sentence. It's clear that Leah is the one who needs to bring Kevin's wife Ellie to a hospital, and she turns to Agathe for assistance in this task.",0,0
1957,"At first Wendy does not believe Elisa, but then she recounts the differences between herself and her family.",she,"0: Elisa, 1: Wendy, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence starts with ""At first Wendy does not believe Elisa""
2. Then it continues with ""but then she recounts the differences...""

The pronoun ""she"" is more likely to refer to Wendy for the following reasons:
1. Wendy is the subject of the first part of the sentence.
2. The sentence structure suggests a change in Wendy's belief or action: ""At first... but then...""
3. It would make more sense for Wendy to recount the differences between herself and her family, as it's presented as a continuation of her initial disbelief.

Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Wendy in this context.",1,1
1958,"Basset was possibly the son of Simon Basset of Sapcote, but his parentage is uncertain.",his,"0: Basset, 1: Simon Basset of Sapcote, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""his"" is referring to Basset, not Simon Basset of Sapcote. The sentence is discussing Basset's parentage, and the pronoun ""his"" is used to indicate uncertainty about Basset's father. Simon Basset of Sapcote is mentioned as a possible father, but the pronoun ""his"" clearly refers to the main subject of the sentence, which is Basset.",0,0
1959,"The chancellor and his wife even offered to house students until they realized that their house, perched on the side of Orchard Hill, was also without water.",they,"0: students, 1: The chancellor and his wife, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""they"" refers to, let's analyze the sentence:

1. The pronoun ""they"" is used in the phrase ""until they realized"".
2. The subject of the sentence is ""The chancellor and his wife"".
3. The action of realizing is attributed to the chancellor and his wife, not the students.
4. It wouldn't make sense for the students to realize that the chancellor's house was without water in this context.
5. The pronoun ""they"" is plural, which matches with ""The chancellor and his wife"" as a collective subject.

Based on these observations, it's clear that ""they"" refers to ""The chancellor and his wife"" rather than the students.",1,1
1960,"Anna proposes to Debra, but she refuses and they break up.",she,"0: Anna, 1: Debra, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Anna proposes to Debra
2. ""she"" refuses
3. They break up

Given this information, it's clear that ""she"" refers to Debra. The logical sequence is:
- Anna is the one proposing
- ""she"" (Debra) is the one refusing the proposal
- As a result of the refusal, they break up

It wouldn't make sense for Anna to refuse her own proposal, so ""she"" must refer to Debra.",1,1
1961,"Marie plans to shoot Alice but in a scuffle she shoots a stray bullet which hits Riley, killing him.",she,"0: Marie, 1: Alice, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Marie for the following reasons:

1. Marie is the subject of the first clause and the main actor in the sentence.
2. The sentence structure suggests that the same person who plans to shoot Alice is also involved in the scuffle.
3. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the context of shooting, which aligns with Marie's initial intention to shoot Alice.

While Alice is mentioned, she is presented as the intended target rather than the actor. There's no indication that Alice was involved in the shooting action. Riley is mentioned later and is referred to as ""him,"" so ""she"" cannot refer to Riley.

Therefore, the most logical conclusion is that ""she"" refers to Marie.",0,0
1962,"Marie calls Elena, but when she picks up the phone, she does not speak.",she,"0: Marie, 1: Elena, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. ""Marie calls Elena"" - This establishes that Marie is the one initiating the call.
2. ""but when she picks up the phone"" - This ""she"" likely refers to Elena, as she would be the one picking up the phone in response to Marie's call.
3. ""she does not speak"" - This ""she"" is most likely referring to the same person who picked up the phone, which we determined to be Elena.

The pronoun ""she"" appears twice in this sentence, and in both cases, it seems to be referring to Elena. Elena is the one who picks up the phone and then doesn't speak. Marie, being the caller, wouldn't be described as picking up the phone in this context.",1,1
1963,"Sophie apologises for hurting Anne, but explains she did not date her to get to the band.",she,"0: Sophie, 1: Anne, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""she"" refers to: Sophie or Anne. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""she did not date her to get to the band."" 

Given the context:
1. Sophie is the subject of the main clause, apologizing to Anne.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in reference to the person who did not date someone else.
3. The pronoun ""her"" in the same clause likely refers to Anne, as it wouldn't make sense for Sophie to date herself.

Therefore, ""she"" in this context must refer to Sophie, as Sophie is the one explaining her actions (not dating Anne to get to the band).",0,0
1964,The attackers had been waiting for the journalists when they arrived.,they,"0: The attackers, 1: the journalists, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" most likely refers to ""the journalists"" for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure suggests a sequence of events: The attackers were waiting, and then the journalists arrived.
2. The use of ""when"" indicates that ""they arrived"" is describing the action of a group that came later, which would be the journalists.
3. It's more logical that the attackers were already in place, waiting for the journalists to arrive, rather than the attackers arriving at their own waiting spot.

Therefore, ""they"" in this context is most likely referring to ""the journalists"" (option 1).",1,1
1965,"A devastated Karine then decided to break up with Jade, even though she still loved her.",she,"0: Jade, 1: Karine, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Karine is the subject of the sentence, performing the action of deciding to break up with Jade.
2. The pronoun ""she"" appears in the clause ""even though she still loved her.""
3. This clause is providing additional information about Karine's feelings, not about Jade.
4. It would make more sense for Karine to still love Jade (the person she's breaking up with) rather than Jade still loving Karine in this context.

Given this analysis, it's most logical that ""she"" refers to Karine. Karine is the one making the decision to break up, and the sentence is describing her conflicting emotions (deciding to break up despite still having feelings).",1,1
1966,"Jadhe tried to get Margaux back, but she denied their relationship.",she,"0: Jadhe, 1: Margaux, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Margaux for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure suggests that Jadhe is the subject performing the action (trying to get Margaux back), while Margaux is the object of this action.

2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the second part of the sentence to describe an action (denying their relationship) that logically follows from and responds to Jadhe's action.

3. It would be more natural for Margaux to deny the relationship in response to Jadhe's attempt to reconcile, rather than Jadhe denying it while trying to get Margaux back.

4. The use of ""their relationship"" implies that the pronoun ""she"" refers to the other person in the relationship, which would be Margaux.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Margaux in this context.",1,1
1967,"Zoey also feels more and more estranged from Erika, because of the lies she tells to hide her relationship with Loren.",she,"0: Zoey, 1: Erika, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence is about Zoey feeling estranged from Erika.
2. The reason for this estrangement is ""the lies she tells.""
3. These lies are told to hide ""her relationship with Loren.""

Given this information, it's more likely that Erika is the one telling lies and hiding a relationship with Loren. Zoey is described as feeling estranged, which implies she is the one observing or being affected by these lies, not the one telling them.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" in this context most likely refers to Erika.",0,1
1968,"Andre has a crush on Kushal, but he refuses his advances.",he,"0: Kushal, 1: Andre, 2: Neither","To determine who ""he"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and the logical flow of the statement.

1. The sentence starts with ""Andre has a crush on Kushal.""
2. Then it says, ""but he refuses his advances.""

The pronoun ""he"" is more likely to refer to Kushal for the following reasons:
1. It's more logical that the person being pursued (Kushal) would be the one refusing advances.
2. If Andre was refusing his own advances, it wouldn't make sense in the context of having a crush.
3. The use of ""but"" suggests a contrast or obstacle to Andre's crush, which would be Kushal's refusal.

Therefore, ""he"" most likely refers to Kushal, who is refusing Andre's advances.",1,0
1969,"Rose then tried to kiss Katie, but she rejected her, so she made her feel uncomfortable by constantly flirting with her.",she,"0: Rose, 1: Katie, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. ""Rose then tried to kiss Katie"" - This establishes Rose as the initiator of the action.
2. ""but she rejected her"" - Here, ""she"" refers to Katie (the one being kissed), and ""her"" refers to Rose (the one being rejected).
3. ""so she made her feel uncomfortable"" - This ""she"" is likely referring to Rose, as it's a continuation of her actions after being rejected.
4. ""by constantly flirting with her"" - This confirms that Rose is the one doing the flirting, and Katie is the one being flirted with.

The pronoun ""she"" appears multiple times in this sentence, and it refers to different people depending on the context. However, the specific ""she"" we're asked about is the one who ""made her feel uncomfortable by constantly flirting with her."" This action is most likely attributed to Rose, as she's the one who initiated the kiss and then continued to pursue Katie after being rejected.",1,0
1970,"Initially, Anna thinks Vanessa is responsible but she tells her it was n't her.",she,"0: Vanessa, 1: Anna, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's break it down:

1. Anna thinks Vanessa is responsible initially.
2. Then ""she tells her it wasn't her.""

The pronoun ""she"" in this context is most likely referring to Vanessa. This is because:

1. The sentence structure suggests a change or contradiction to the initial thought.
2. It would make more sense for Vanessa to be the one telling Anna that she (Vanessa) wasn't responsible, rather than Anna telling herself.
3. The natural flow of the sentence implies that the subject (Vanessa) is responding to the accusation.

Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Vanessa in this context.",0,0
1971,"Delana reluctantly agrees, not for Mathilda, but because she dislikes someone getting away with murder.",she,"0: Delana, 1: Mathilda, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" clearly refers to Delana. The sentence structure indicates that Delana is the subject who is reluctantly agreeing. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the same clause to describe Delana's motivation for agreeing, which is her dislike of someone getting away with murder. Mathilda is only mentioned as a secondary character in the context of Delana's decision, not as the subject of the action or the holder of the opinion described by ""she.""",0,0
1972,Valerie initially suspects Rosemarie but she is not convinced that she is the murderer.,she,"0: Valerie, 1: Rosemarie, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""she"" the pronoun refers to. There are two instances of ""she"" in the sentence, and we need to analyze them separately:

1. First ""she"": ""...but she is not convinced...""
   This ""she"" likely refers to Valerie because Valerie is the subject of the first part of the sentence and is the one doing the suspecting. It makes sense that Valerie is the one who is not convinced.

2. Second ""she"": ""...that she is the murderer.""
   This ""she"" refers to Rosemarie because Rosemarie is the object of Valerie's suspicion. The sentence is about Valerie suspecting Rosemarie of being the murderer.

Since the question asks about the pronoun ""she"" without specifying which instance, and the first instance is more prominent (being the subject of the main clause), we should consider the first ""she"" as the primary reference. Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Valerie.",1,"0

[["
1973,Barbara is furious with Bianca when she learns the truth about her accident.,she,"0: Barbara, 1: Bianca, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Barbara. The sentence structure suggests that Barbara is the subject who is experiencing the emotion (being furious) and learning something. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""when she learns the truth,"" which is directly connected to Barbara's emotional state. It's more logical that Barbara would be learning about Bianca's accident rather than Bianca learning about her own accident. Therefore, ""she"" in this context refers to Barbara.",0,0
1974,"Cathy attempts to seduce Diane, but she resists her temptations, which infuriates her.",she,"0: Cathy, 1: Diane, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. ""Cathy attempts to seduce Diane"" - This establishes Cathy as the initiator of the seduction.
2. ""but she resists her temptations"" - Here, ""she"" refers to Diane, as she is the one being seduced and thus in a position to resist. ""Her"" refers to Cathy's temptations.
3. ""which infuriates her"" - This ""her"" is more likely to refer to Cathy, as she would be the one infuriated by the resistance to her seduction attempt.

The pronoun ""she"" in question appears in the phrase ""she resists her temptations"". In this context, it clearly refers to Diane, as she is the one being seduced and therefore in a position to resist the temptations.",1,1
1975,But never for once does Golnar speaks against Durdaana even if she knows that she is wrong and is lying.,she,"0: Golnar, 1: Durdaana, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""she"" the pronoun refers to. The sentence structure suggests that ""she"" refers to Golnar rather than Durdaana. This is because:

1. The sentence starts with ""But never for once does Golnar speaks against Durdaana,"" establishing Golnar as the main subject.
2. The phrase ""even if she knows"" is more likely to refer back to the main subject (Golnar) rather than introducing new information about Durdaana.
3. The context implies that Golnar is aware of Durdaana being wrong and lying, but chooses not to speak against her. This knowledge is attributed to Golnar, not Durdaana.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" in this sentence most likely refers to Golnar.",0,0
1976,"Eva misunderstands a conversation with Joelle about moving out, so she begins looking at flats for them.",she,"0: Eva, 1: Joelle, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" refers to Eva. We can determine this because:

1. Eva is mentioned first in the sentence, making her the primary subject.
2. The sentence describes a misunderstanding by Eva, which leads to an action.
3. The pronoun ""she"" is used to describe the person who ""begins looking at flats for them,"" which is a direct result of Eva's misunderstanding.

The action of looking at flats is clearly linked to Eva's misunderstanding, not to Joelle. Therefore, ""she"" in this context refers to Eva.",0,0
1977,"Emma tries to control Julia, but she is strong.",she,"0: Julia, 1: Emma, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence structure suggests a contrast between Emma's actions and the characteristics of ""she"".
2. Emma is described as trying to control Julia.
3. The pronoun ""she"" is described as being strong.
4. Logically, the strength mentioned is likely a quality that resists or counters the attempt at control.

Given this analysis, it makes more sense for ""she"" to refer to Julia rather than Emma. Julia's strength is presented as a contrast to Emma's attempt to control her. If ""she"" referred to Emma, the sentence would not have the same logical flow or contrast.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Julia.",1,0
1978,The strangers are almost stoned to death by the town's inhabitants but they manages to escape.,they,"0: The strangers, 1: the town 's inhabitants, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""they"" refers to ""The strangers"" for the following reasons:

1. Subject-verb agreement: The verb ""manages"" is in the singular form, which agrees with ""they"" used as a singular pronoun. This indicates that ""they"" is referring to a collective noun treated as a single entity.

2. Logical flow: The sentence describes a sequence of events where the strangers are almost stoned, but then escape. It makes more sense for the strangers to be the ones escaping, rather than the town's inhabitants.

3. Contextual understanding: The strangers are the main subject of the sentence and the ones in danger. It's more likely that the pronoun refers to them as they are the focus of the action.

Therefore, the pronoun ""they"" most likely refers to ""The strangers"" (candidate 0).",0,0
1979,"Gina does not warm to Tracy at first, but she grows to adore her and usually stand up for her.",her,"0: Gina, 1: Tracy, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. The pronoun ""her"" appears twice in the sentence.
2. The first ""her"" in ""...but she grows to adore her..."" refers to Tracy. This is because Gina is the subject of the sentence and ""she"" refers back to Gina, so ""her"" must refer to Tracy.
3. The second ""her"" in ""...and usually stand up for her"" also refers to Tracy. This is a continuation of the previous clause, maintaining the same reference.

Both instances of ""her"" refer to Tracy, not Gina. The sentence describes Gina's changing feelings and actions towards Tracy, with Tracy being the object of Gina's adoration and support.",0,1
1980,The next day Golnar finds Abhilasha crying because she is overwhelmed by Siddharth's friends acting wildly inside the apartment.,she,"0: Abhilasha, 1: Golnar, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" clearly refers to Abhilasha. The text states that ""Golnar finds Abhilasha crying because she is overwhelmed."" The pronoun ""she"" is used to describe the person who is crying and feeling overwhelmed, which is Abhilasha in this context. Golnar is the one who finds Abhilasha in this state, so ""she"" cannot refer to Golnar.",0,0
1981,Phoebe wants Rachel to stop interfering because her presence leaves her nervous.,her,"0: Phoebe, 1: Rachel, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""her"" refers to Phoebe or Rachel. Let's analyze the context:

1. The first ""her"" in ""her presence"" likely refers to Rachel because:
   - The sentence is about Phoebe wanting Rachel to stop interfering.
   - It wouldn't make sense for Phoebe to be nervous about her own presence.

2. The second ""her"" in ""leaves her nervous"" refers to Phoebe because:
   - Phoebe is the subject of the sentence and the one who wants Rachel to stop interfering.
   - It's logical that Rachel's presence would make Phoebe nervous, not Rachel herself.

Since the question asks about ""her"" without specifying which one, and both instances refer to different people, we cannot definitively choose between Phoebe and Rachel. Therefore, the appropriate answer is 2 (Neither), as we can't uniquely identify a single referent for ""her"" in this context.",1,2
1982,Morty seeks to have Rick reprogrammed illegally so he is capable of protecting him from Roger.,he,"0: Morty, 1: Rick, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Morty is the subject of the sentence, seeking to have Rick reprogrammed.
2. The purpose of reprogramming Rick is stated as ""so he is capable of protecting him from Roger.""

The pronoun ""he"" in this context refers to Rick for the following reasons:
- It's more logical that Rick would be the one protecting Morty, rather than Morty protecting himself.
- The sentence structure suggests that Rick is the one being reprogrammed to gain the capability of protection.
- ""him"" in the latter part of the sentence likely refers to Morty, further indicating that ""he"" refers to Rick.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Rick in this context.",1,1
1983,"Alexandra asks the patient, Iris, but she denies any drug use.",she,"0: Alexandra, 1: the patient , Iris, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. Alexandra is the subject of the sentence, performing the action of asking.
2. Iris is identified as the patient, and is the object of Alexandra's action.
3. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""she denies any drug use.""

Given this structure, it's more likely that ""she"" refers to Iris (the patient) rather than Alexandra. This is because:

1. The denial of drug use is more likely to come from the patient being questioned, not the person asking the question.
2. In English, when a new subject is introduced (in this case, Iris), subsequent pronouns often refer to this new subject rather than reverting to the original subject.

Therefore, the most logical conclusion is that ""she"" refers to Iris, the patient.",1,1
1984,"Zoe returned and reconciled with Johanna, although she made it clear she was not interested in sex.",she,"0: Zoe, 1: Johanna, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""she"" refers to when it says ""she made it clear she was not interested in sex."" Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Zoe returned and reconciled with Johanna.""
2. Then it says ""although she made it clear...""

The pronoun ""she"" is more likely to refer to Zoe for the following reasons:
1. Zoe is the subject of the first part of the sentence, making her the more prominent actor.
2. The sentence structure suggests that the person who ""returned and reconciled"" is the same person making something clear.
3. It's more natural to describe the actions and intentions of the person who is returning and reconciling, rather than the person being reconciled with.

Therefore, it's most probable that ""she"" refers to Zoe in this context.",0,0
1985,Kathy paid Jane to leave but she returned several weeks later.,she,"0: Kathy, 1: Jane, 2: Neither","To determine who ""she"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and the most logical interpretation:

1. Kathy paid Jane to leave: This implies that Kathy wanted Jane to go away.
2. ""But she returned several weeks later"": This suggests that the person who left came back.

Given this information, it's more likely that ""she"" refers to Jane because:
- Jane was the one who was paid to leave, implying she did leave.
- The sentence states that ""she returned,"" which aligns with Jane being the one who left and then came back.
- It wouldn't make sense for Kathy to return if she was the one paying someone else to leave.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Jane.",1,1
1986,"Tania thinks about cancelling on Vanessa, but she later arrives with dessert.",she,"0: Tania, 1: Vanessa, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. The sentence starts with ""Tania thinks about cancelling on Vanessa"".
2. Then it says ""but she later arrives with dessert"".

The pronoun ""she"" in this context refers to the person who arrives with dessert. Given the structure of the sentence, it's more likely that this is Tania for the following reasons:

1. Tania is the subject of the first part of the sentence, making her the primary actor.
2. The sentence implies a change of mind: Tania considers cancelling, but then does the opposite by arriving.
3. If Vanessa was the one arriving, it would be odd to mention Tania's thoughts about cancelling, as Vanessa's arrival would be unrelated to Tania's internal debate.

Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Tania, who initially thought about cancelling but then decided to go and even brought dessert.",0,0
1987,"Isaac blackmails Raja saying that if he does not forfeit, he will bring his twin brother to Kari.",he,"0: Isaac, 1: Raja, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""he"" refers to: Isaac or Raja. Let's analyze the context:

1. Isaac is the subject of the sentence, performing the action of blackmailing.
2. Raja is the object of the blackmail, being told to forfeit.
3. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the conditional clause ""if he does not forfeit.""

Given this context, it's clear that the person who needs to forfeit is Raja, not Isaac. Isaac is making the threat, while Raja is the one being threatened to forfeit. Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" in this sentence refers to Raja.",0,1
1988,Kendrick went to Mr. Cooke and asked if he would help them build a church on South Bass Island.,he,"0: Kendrick, 1: Mr. Cooke, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Mr. Cooke for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure suggests that Kendrick is the subject who is performing the action of asking.
2. ""Mr. Cooke"" is the most recently mentioned male individual before the pronoun ""he"" appears.
3. It would make more sense in context for Kendrick to ask Mr. Cooke for help, rather than asking himself.
4. The phrase ""if he would help them"" implies that the person being asked is someone other than Kendrick, as Kendrick is likely included in the ""them"" who need help.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Mr. Cooke (candidate 1).",0,1
1989,"Drucilla was also attracted to Emmy, but she did not seem to care for her.",she,"0: Drucilla, 1: Emmy, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Drucilla is attracted to Emmy.
2. ""She"" did not seem to care for ""her"".

The pronoun ""she"" is more likely to refer to Emmy because:
- The sentence structure suggests a contrast between Drucilla's feelings and Emmy's feelings.
- ""She"" is the subject of ""did not seem to care,"" which contrasts with Drucilla's attraction.
- ""Her"" at the end of the sentence likely refers back to Drucilla, further indicating that ""she"" is Emmy.

Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Emmy, who doesn't seem to care for Drucilla.",1,1
1990,"Sharon attempted to hang on to Skye, but she was not strong enough to pull her up.",she,"0: Sharon, 1: Skye, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. Sharon is the subject of the sentence, attempting to hang on to Skye.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""she was not strong enough to pull her up.""
3. This clause describes a lack of strength, which logically refers to the person doing the action of trying to pull someone up.
4. Sharon is the one trying to hang on to Skye, implying she's also the one trying to pull Skye up.
5. Therefore, ""she"" in this context refers to Sharon, as Sharon is the one who is not strong enough to pull Skye up.",0,0
1991,Emma tries to woo Stacey but she keeps turning her down.,she,"0: Emma, 1: Stacey, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Emma is trying to woo Stacey.
2. ""She"" is the subject of ""keeps turning her down.""

Given this information, it's clear that ""she"" refers to Stacey because:
- Emma is the one doing the wooing, so she's the active party.
- Stacey is the one being wooed, and she's the one doing the turning down.
- ""She keeps turning her down"" implies that Stacey is rejecting Emma's advances.

Therefore, ""she"" in this context refers to Stacey.",1,1
1992,Jim defeats Laroche but spares him and makes his way to the Forgotten's settlement.,him,"0: Jim, 1: Laroche, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""him"" refers to Laroche. We can determine this because:

1. The sentence structure indicates that Jim is the subject performing the actions (defeating and sparing).
2. ""him"" is used as the object of the verb ""spares,"" which means it refers to the person being spared.
3. Laroche is the only other person mentioned in the sentence, and he is the logical recipient of Jim's actions.

Therefore, ""him"" refers to Laroche, which corresponds to candidate 1.",0,1
1993,Soichi is killed and Jim forced to surrender when he finds NEVEC has taken his family hostage.,he,"0: Soichi, 1: Jim, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" clearly refers to Jim. The sentence structure indicates that Jim is the subject of the second part of the sentence, where ""he finds NEVEC has taken his family hostage."" This action of finding out about the hostage situation is attributed to Jim, not Soichi. Soichi is mentioned as being killed, which means he cannot be the one who later discovers something about hostages. Therefore, ""he"" must refer to Jim.",1,1
1994,"Amy attempts to court Babs, but she is not vulnerable to her advances.",she,"0: Amy, 1: Babs, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Amy is the subject of the sentence, attempting to court Babs.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the second part of the sentence, describing someone who is not vulnerable to advances.
3. Logically, the person who would be vulnerable (or not) to advances would be the one being courted, not the one doing the courting.
4. Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Babs, as she is the one being courted and not vulnerable to Amy's advances.

The sentence structure suggests that ""she"" is contrasting with Amy's actions, further supporting that it refers to Babs.",0,1
1995,Inoue later trained under Yasuhiro Konishi where he studied the weapons practice of Ryky Kobudo Hozon Shinkokai.,he,"0: Inoue, 1: Yasuhiro Konishi, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence begins with ""Inoue,"" making him the primary subject.
2. The pronoun ""he"" appears in the latter part of the sentence, referring to the person who studied the weapons practice.
3. It's more likely that Inoue, as the main subject, is the one who studied under Yasuhiro Konishi and then studied the weapons practice.
4. Yasuhiro Konishi is mentioned as the person under whom Inoue trained, making it less likely that ""he"" refers to Konishi.

Based on these observations, it's most logical that ""he"" refers to Inoue, as he is the main subject of the sentence and the one performing the actions described.",1,0
1996,"Ava decides to reconcile with Lynette, but when she sees another girl undressing her, she decides to walk away.",she,"0: Ava, 1: Lynette, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""she"" refers to: Ava or Lynette. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Ava decides to reconcile with Lynette.""
2. Then it says, ""but when she sees another girl undressing her...""
3. Finally, it concludes with ""she decides to walk away.""

The pronoun ""she"" in this context most likely refers to Ava because:

1. Ava is the subject of the first clause and the main actor in the sentence.
2. The action of seeing ""another girl undressing her (Lynette)"" and then deciding to walk away is a continuation of Ava's initial action of deciding to reconcile.
3. It makes more sense in the context that Ava would be the one walking away after seeing Lynette with another girl, as this explains why the reconciliation didn't happen.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" in this sentence refers to Ava.",0,0
1997,"Shary asks Tania accusingly where she was at the time of the accident, and the movie ends as she begins to cry from guilt.",she,"0: Shary, 1: Tania, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence describes Shary asking Tania a question.
2. The pronoun ""she"" appears twice in the sentence.
3. The first ""she"" is used in ""where she was at the time of the accident."" This likely refers to Tania, as Shary is asking about Tania's whereabouts.
4. The second ""she"" is used in ""she begins to cry from guilt."" This also likely refers to Tania for two reasons:
   a) It's more natural for the person being accused (Tania) to cry from guilt.
   b) If it referred to Shary, the sentence would likely use Shary's name again to avoid ambiguity.

Given these points, both instances of ""she"" in the sentence most likely refer to Tania.",1,1
1998,"Emily struggles to convince herself that being friends with Rachel is enough, but she has to admit it bothers her just to see Rachel and Cassandra talking together.",she,"0: Emily, 1: Rachel, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. The first part of the sentence is about Emily's internal struggle.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the phrase ""she has to admit"".
3. This admission is directly related to Emily's feelings about Rachel and Cassandra's interaction.

Given this context, it's clear that ""she"" refers to Emily. Emily is the subject of the sentence and the one experiencing the emotions described. The pronoun ""she"" is used to continue talking about Emily's thoughts and feelings.

Rachel is mentioned, but she's not the subject of the sentence or the one doing the admitting. Cassandra is only mentioned in passing and isn't a candidate for the pronoun.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" refers to Emily (candidate 0).",0,0
1999,"DeLuna began wondering why Hernandez was taking so long, so he stepped outside Wolfy's to see what was going on.",he,"0: DeLuna, 1: Hernandez, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to DeLuna. The sentence structure indicates that DeLuna is the subject who performed the action of stepping outside Wolfy's. The pronoun ""he"" is used to avoid repeating DeLuna's name in the second part of the sentence. Hernandez is mentioned as the person DeLuna was wondering about, but Hernandez is not the one performing the action described by the pronoun ""he"".",1,0
2000,Mrs. Bowen is glad Angelina is staying but she doesnt seemed pleased with the reason.,she,"0: Angelina, 1: Mrs. Bowen, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Mrs. Bowen for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure suggests that Mrs. Bowen is the main subject of the sentence.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the second part of the sentence to describe someone's reaction to Angelina staying.
3. It would be more natural for Mrs. Bowen, as an authority figure (implied by the title ""Mrs.""), to have an opinion about Angelina staying and the reason for it.
4. If ""she"" referred to Angelina, the sentence would be somewhat redundant, as it would be stating that Angelina is glad she's staying but not pleased with her own reason.

Therefore, it makes more sense for ""she"" to refer to Mrs. Bowen, who is glad about Angelina staying but not pleased with the reason for it.",0,1
2001,"Anna leans in to kiss Cassie, but she pulls away and runs off.",she,"0: Anna, 1: Cassie, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to - Anna or Cassie. Let's analyze the context:

1. Anna is the subject of the first part of the sentence, initiating the action of leaning in to kiss Cassie.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the second part of the sentence, describing someone who pulls away and runs off.
3. Logically, the person pulling away would be the one being kissed, not the one initiating the kiss.
4. Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Cassie, as she is the one reacting to Anna's action by pulling away and running off.

Based on this analysis, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Cassie.",1,1
2002,Toadie becomes angry with Troy when he takes Callum to Puckapunyal without permission.,he,"0: Toadie, 1: Troy, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Toadie becomes angry with Troy...""
2. This is followed by ""when he takes Callum...""

The pronoun ""he"" is more likely to refer to Troy for the following reasons:
1. Troy is the object of Toadie's anger, which suggests that Troy has done something to provoke this anger.
2. The action of taking Callum without permission is the reason for Toadie's anger, implying that Troy is the one who performed this action.
3. It's more natural to use a pronoun to refer to the most recently mentioned person (Troy) rather than the subject of the main clause (Toadie).

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Troy.",1,1
2003,"Yoshiari was a son of Emperor Montoku, although he was granted the surname Minamoto which removed him from the Imperial lineage.",he,"0: Yoshiari, 1: Emperor Montoku, 2: Neither","The pronoun ""he"" in this sentence refers to Yoshiari, not Emperor Montoku. This is evident from the structure of the sentence:

1. The first part introduces Yoshiari as the subject: ""Yoshiari was a son of Emperor Montoku""
2. The second part, connected by ""although,"" continues to provide information about Yoshiari: ""he was granted the surname Minamoto""

The pronoun ""he"" is used to avoid repeating Yoshiari's name in the second part of the sentence. It maintains the focus on Yoshiari as the main subject of the sentence, describing his relationship to Emperor Montoku and then providing additional information about Yoshiari himself.",1,0
2004,"Wolfe has no explanation of the phone book for Archie, but he does have instructions.",he,"0: Wolfe, 1: Archie, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Wolfe. We can determine this because:

1. Wolfe is the subject of the first part of the sentence, making him the most prominent entity.
2. The sentence structure indicates that Wolfe is the one who ""has no explanation"" and ""does have instructions.""
3. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the second part of the sentence to continue referring to the same subject (Wolfe) from the first part.
4. Archie is mentioned only as an indirect object in relation to the phone book, not as the main actor in the sentence.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Wolfe, which corresponds to candidate 0.",1,0
2005,"Carrie tries to apologize to Olivia, but she rebuffs her and goes back to her family.",she,"0: Carrie, 1: Olivia, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""she"" refers to: Carrie or Olivia. Let's break down the sentence:

1. Carrie tries to apologize to Olivia
2. ""she rebuffs her""
3. ""she"" goes back to her family

The pronoun ""she"" in question is the subject of the actions ""rebuffs"" and ""goes back."" Given the context, it's more logical that Olivia is the one rebuffing Carrie's apology and then going back to her family. 

Carrie is the one apologizing, so she wouldn't be rebuffing herself. Additionally, the act of going back to ""her family"" implies that Olivia is the one distancing herself from the interaction and returning to her family members.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" in this context refers to Olivia.",1,1
2006,"Clementine falls in love with Clara eventually, but she hesitates to tell her.",she,"0: Clara, 1: Clementine, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the context of hesitating to tell someone something. Given the structure of the sentence, it's more logical that Clementine is the one hesitating to tell Clara about her feelings, rather than Clara hesitating to tell Clementine. 

The sentence starts with ""Clementine falls in love with Clara,"" which establishes Clementine as the subject who has developed feelings. The second part of the sentence, ""but she hesitates to tell her,"" continues to focus on Clementine's actions and feelings. It would be less coherent for the subject to suddenly switch to Clara in this context.

Therefore, ""she"" in this sentence most likely refers to Clementine.",0,1
2007,"Likewise now, Nisha was forced to give the ring to Khimya, or she would have killed her brother.",she,"0: Khimya, 1: Nisha, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions two female names: Nisha and Khimya.
2. The pronoun ""she"" appears in the clause ""or she would have killed her brother.""
3. The sentence structure suggests that ""she"" is the person who would kill someone's brother if the ring wasn't given.
4. Logically, Nisha is being forced to give the ring to Khimya, implying that Khimya is the one making the threat.
5. Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Khimya, as she is the one who would potentially kill Nisha's brother if the ring wasn't given.

Based on this analysis, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Khimya.",0,0
2008,Esmeralda was employed by Lady Elgin even though she was not able to speak English.,she,"0: Esmeralda, 1: Lady Elgin, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions two people: Esmeralda and Lady Elgin.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""she was not able to speak English.""
3. This clause provides additional information about one of the two people mentioned.
4. It's more logical that this information refers to Esmeralda, as it explains why her employment by Lady Elgin might be considered unusual.
5. It's less likely that Lady Elgin, who is employing someone, would not be able to speak English.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Esmeralda.",1,0
2009,Rachel becomes jealous of Jessica when she sees her kissing another girl.,she,"0: Rachel, 1: Jessica, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Rachel becomes jealous of Jessica
2. ""she"" sees ""her"" kissing another girl

The pronoun ""she"" is the subject of the action ""sees,"" and ""her"" is the object being seen. Given that Rachel is the one becoming jealous, it makes sense that Rachel would be the one seeing Jessica kissing another girl, which causes her jealousy.

Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Rachel (candidate 0).",0,0
2010,"When Lily asks Anna where Anders is, she is n't able to answer.",she,"0: Lily, 1: Anna, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Lily is asking Anna a question about Anders' whereabouts.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in reference to someone who ""isn't able to answer.""

Given this information, it's most logical that ""she"" refers to Anna. Anna is the one being asked the question, and she is unable to provide an answer. Lily is the one asking the question, so it wouldn't make sense for her to be unable to answer her own question.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Anna.",0,1
2011,"Michael then plans to kill Paul, so he orders sleeping tablets from the internet.",he,"0: Michael, 1: Paul, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" clearly refers to Michael. The sentence structure indicates that Michael is the subject who is taking action. Michael is planning to kill Paul, and it is Michael who orders the sleeping tablets.

2012,"Sophia tries to convince Alice to plead not guilty, but she pleads guilty to murder.",she,"0: Sophia, 1: Alice, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine whether the pronoun ""she"" refers to Sophia or Alice. Let's analyze the context:

1. Sophia is trying to convince Alice to plead not guilty.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""she pleads guilty to murder.""

Given this information, it's clear that ""she"" refers to Alice because:
a) Sophia is the one doing the convincing, so she wouldn't be the one pleading guilty.
b) The sentence structure indicates that Alice is the subject of the second clause, as she is the one being convinced and then making a decision contrary to Sophia's advice.

Therefore, ""she"" in this context refers to Alice, who pleads guilty despite Sophia's attempts to convince her otherwise.",1,1
2013,"Rosalie starts to get closer to Alice, so she can get her into bed.",she,"0: Rosalie, 1: Alice, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""she"" refers to: Rosalie or Alice. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Rosalie starts to get closer to Alice.""
2. The pronoun ""she"" appears in the clause ""so she can get her into bed.""

Given this structure, it's clear that Rosalie is the subject of the sentence and the one performing the action. She is getting closer to Alice with the intention of getting Alice into bed. Therefore, ""she"" refers to Rosalie, as she is the one with the active role in this sentence.

Alice is the object of Rosalie's actions, referred to as ""her"" in the latter part of the sentence. This further confirms that ""she"" must refer to Rosalie.",0,0
2014,Maggie flirts with Stella but she tells her she is seeing Olivia Falconeri.,she,"0: Maggie, 1: Stella, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. ""Maggie flirts with Stella"" - This establishes the initial action.
2. ""but she tells her"" - Here, we have two pronouns: ""she"" and ""her"".
3. ""she is seeing Olivia Falconeri"" - This is the key information.

The pronoun ""she"" in question is likely referring to the person who is seeing Olivia Falconeri. Given the context, it's more probable that Stella is the one in a relationship with Olivia, rather than Maggie (who was flirting with Stella).

The sentence structure suggests that Stella is rejecting Maggie's flirtation by informing her about her relationship with Olivia. Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Stella.",1,1
2015,"Hill was determined to work with Scorsese, and wanted to play Donnie Azoff so badly that he was willing to do whatever it took to get the part.",he,"0: Hill, 1: Scorsese, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" clearly refers to Hill. The context of the sentence indicates that Hill was the one who was determined to work with Scorsese and wanted to play Donnie Azoff. The pronoun ""he"" is used to continue referring to Hill's actions and willingness to do whatever it took to get the part. Scorsese is mentioned as the person Hill wanted to work with, but he is not the subject of the actions described by the pronoun ""he"".",0,0
2016,"Valene finds out and kicks Rachel out, so she moves in with Abby.",she,"0: Valene, 1: Rachel, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Valene finds out something (unspecified).
2. Valene kicks Rachel out.
3. ""She"" moves in with Abby.

Given this sequence of events, it's most logical that ""she"" refers to Rachel. The reason is:

- Valene is the one doing the action of kicking Rachel out.
- It wouldn't make sense for Valene to kick Rachel out and then move in with Abby herself.
- The natural consequence of Rachel being kicked out is that she would need a new place to live.
- Moving in with Abby is presented as a direct result of being kicked out.

Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Rachel, who needs a new place to stay after being kicked out by Valene.",1,1
2017,"Jean tries to seduce Roxy's boyfriend Luke Cunningham, but he rebuffs him.",he,"0: Jean, 1: Roxy 's boyfriend Luke Cunningham, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Jean is trying to seduce Luke Cunningham.
2. ""he rebuffs him"" is the key phrase.

The pronoun ""he"" is the subject of the verb ""rebuffs,"" and ""him"" is the object. Since Jean is the one trying to seduce Luke, it makes sense that Luke would be the one doing the rebuffing. Therefore, ""he"" refers to Luke Cunningham, who is rejecting Jean's advances.

Roxy is only mentioned as Luke's girlfriend and doesn't play an active role in this action, so we can rule her out.",1,1
2018,"Wendy tries to win back Beth, but she is dating Wayne Duncan.",she,"0: Wendy, 1: Beth, 2: Neither","To determine who ""she"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and grammatical structure:

1. The sentence starts with ""Wendy tries to win back Beth"".
2. This implies that Wendy and Beth had a previous relationship, and Wendy is trying to rekindle it.
3. The second part of the sentence says ""but she is dating Wayne Duncan"".
4. The use of ""but"" indicates a contrast or obstacle to Wendy's attempt to win Beth back.
5. Logically, if Wendy is trying to win Beth back, it makes more sense that Beth would be the one dating someone else, as this would be the obstacle to Wendy's efforts.

Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Beth in this context.",1,1
2019,Razia unsuccessfully tries to convince Rachel but she rejects all her plea and goes for duty.,she,"0: Razia, 1: Rachel, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Razia is trying to convince Rachel.
2. ""She"" rejects all her plea.
3. ""She"" goes for duty.

Based on this information, we can deduce that ""she"" refers to Rachel because:
- Rachel is the one being convinced, so she would be the one to reject the plea.
- Going for duty implies that Rachel has a job or responsibility to attend to, which aligns with her rejecting Razia's plea.
- It wouldn't make sense for Razia to reject her own plea.

Therefore, ""she"" in this context refers to Rachel.",1,1
2020,Chester tries to kill Dave but he is stopped by Stephanie and Martha.,he,"0: Chester, 1: Dave, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Chester. The sentence structure suggests that Chester is the subject who is trying to kill Dave, and then ""he"" (Chester) is stopped by Stephanie and Martha. It wouldn't make sense for ""he"" to refer to Dave in this context, as Dave is the object of Chester's action, not the one being stopped.",0,0
2021,Aidan later finds Chris to see if he is okay and he offers to sneak him back into the hospital.,he,"0: Aidan, 1: Chris, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which 'he' refers to Aidan or Chris. Let's break it down:

1. 'Aidan later finds Chris' - This establishes Aidan as the subject performing the action.
2. 'to see if he is okay' - This 'he' likely refers to Chris, as Aidan is checking on Chris's well-being.
3. 'and he offers to sneak him back into the hospital' - This is the crucial part. The 'he' who is offering is more likely to be Aidan, as he is the one who found Chris and is now taking action. The 'him' in this part refers to Chris, who would be sneaked back into the hospital.

Given this analysis, the pronoun 'he' in the question most likely refers to Aidan, as he is the one offering to help Chris.",1,0
2022,"Ravi is in love with Kushal, but, he does not agree.",he,"0: Ravi, 1: Kushal, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence presents two male individuals: Ravi and Kushal.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the second part of the sentence, after the comma.
3. The sentence states that ""he does not agree,"" which implies a disagreement with the first part of the sentence.
4. The first part of the sentence states that ""Ravi is in love with Kushal.""
5. Logically, the person who would be more likely to disagree with this statement is Kushal, not Ravi.

Given this analysis, it's more probable that ""he"" refers to Kushal, as he would be the one more likely to disagree with Ravi's feelings towards him.",1,1
2023,Pradhan Jaipal comes to meet Arun and Sanchita but gets tensed when he does not find anyone in the house and he waits for them.,he,"0: Pradhan Jaipal, 1: Arun and Sanchita, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" is used twice, and in both instances, it refers to Pradhan Jaipal. Let's break it down:

1. ""Pradhan Jaipal comes to meet Arun and Sanchita"" - This introduces Pradhan Jaipal as the main subject of the sentence.

2. ""but gets tensed when he does not find anyone in the house"" - Here, ""he"" refers to Pradhan Jaipal, as he is the one who came to meet Arun and Sanchita and is now experiencing tension.

3. ""and he waits for them"" - Again, ""he"" refers to Pradhan Jaipal, who is waiting for Arun and Sanchita.

The pronoun ""he"" consistently refers to Pradhan Jaipal throughout the sentence, making him the clear referent.",0,0
2024,Marta arranges a series of dates with Johanna but she does not turn up and spends time with Elena.,she,"0: Marta, 1: Johanna, 2: Neither","To determine who ""she"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and the actions described:

1. Marta arranges dates with Johanna.
2. Someone (""she"") does not turn up to these dates.
3. This same person (""she"") spends time with Elena instead.

Given this information, it's more likely that ""she"" refers to Johanna rather than Marta. The reasons are:

1. Marta is the one arranging the dates, so it wouldn't make sense for her to be the one not showing up.
2. The sentence implies that the person who doesn't turn up is choosing to spend time with Elena instead of going on the arranged dates.
3. It's more logical for Johanna to be the one not showing up to dates that Marta arranged.

Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Johanna in this context.",1,1
2025,Pushpa was in love with Koustuv but he was an advanced soul.,he,"0: Pushpa, 1: Koustuv, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Koustuv for the following reasons:

1. Gender agreement: ""He"" is a masculine pronoun, which matches with Koustuv (typically a male name) rather than Pushpa (typically a female name).

2. Sentence structure: The pronoun ""he"" appears in the second part of the sentence, following the introduction of both Pushpa and Koustuv. This structure suggests that ""he"" is referring to the most recently mentioned person, which is Koustuv.

3. Context: The sentence describes Koustuv as ""an advanced soul,"" which is presented as additional information about ""he."" This description is more likely to be about Koustuv, the object of Pushpa's love, rather than about Pushpa herself.

Therefore, based on these factors, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Koustuv.",0,1
2026,Paul Thompson was meant to star opposite Gosia Dobrowolska but he dropped out of the project at the least moment and was replaced by Sean Scully.,he,"0: Gosia Dobrowolska, 1: Paul Thompson, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" clearly refers to Paul Thompson. The sentence states that ""Paul Thompson was meant to star opposite Gosia Dobrowolska but he dropped out of the project."" The pronoun ""he"" is used to avoid repeating Paul Thompson's name and directly refers to his action of dropping out of the project. Gosia Dobrowolska is mentioned, but as she is a female, ""he"" cannot refer to her. There's no indication that ""he"" refers to anyone else not mentioned in the candidates.",1,1
2027,"Prabha gets pregnant and deliveres a baby girl, Arushi but she does not care much for her.",she,"0: Prabha, 1: a baby girl , Arushi, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Prabha is mentioned first as the subject who gets pregnant and delivers a baby girl.
2. The baby girl is named Arushi.
3. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""she does not care much for her.""

Given the structure of the sentence, it's more likely that ""she"" refers to Prabha rather than the baby girl, Arushi. This is because:

1. Prabha is the main subject of the sentence and the one performing the actions (getting pregnant and delivering).
2. It would be unusual for a baby to be described as not caring for someone else, especially immediately after birth.
3. The phrase ""care much for her"" implies that ""she"" is the caregiver, which would be Prabha in this context.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Prabha.",0,0
2028,Kian is supportive of Callum when he leaves for the United States on a scholarship.,he,"0: Kian, 1: Callum, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions two people: Kian and Callum.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""when he leaves for the United States on a scholarship.""
3. The sentence structure suggests that Kian is supportive of Callum's action.
4. The action of leaving for the United States on a scholarship is more likely to be associated with Callum, as Kian is described as being supportive of this action.

Based on this analysis, it is most logical that ""he"" refers to Callum, as he is the one leaving for the United States on a scholarship, while Kian is supporting him in this endeavor.",1,1
2029,Adam proposes that Brody should be brought in to see if he can identify the mystery man.,he,"0: Adam, 1: Brody, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Brody. The context suggests that Adam is proposing to bring Brody in for a specific purpose - to identify the mystery man. The use of ""he"" in ""see if he can identify"" logically points to Brody being the one who might be able to make the identification, not Adam (who is making the proposal) or the mystery man (who is the subject of identification).",1,1
2030,"Will neglects to tell Sonny, because he is n't sure he wants to take Arianna away from him.",he,"0: Sonny, 1: Will, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. The pronoun ""he"" appears twice in the sentence.
2. The first ""he"" refers to Will, as it's Will who is not sure about something.
3. The second ""he"" also refers to Will, as it's talking about Will potentially taking Arianna away from Sonny.
4. The sentence structure suggests that Will is the subject who is making the decision and having doubts.
5. Sonny is mentioned as the person from whom Arianna might be taken away, so he's not the one referred to by ""he"".

Given this analysis, both instances of ""he"" in the sentence refer to Will, not Sonny.",0,1
2031,"Catherine is abducted by Phoebe, but Grobart protects her.",her,"0: Catherine, 1: Phoebe, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""her"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions two female characters: Catherine and Phoebe.
2. The pronoun ""her"" appears at the end of the sentence in the phrase ""protects her.""
3. The sentence structure suggests that ""her"" refers to the person being protected, not the abductor.
4. Catherine is mentioned as being abducted, which puts her in a position of needing protection.
5. Phoebe is mentioned as the abductor, so it's unlikely that she would be the one being protected.

Given this analysis, it's most logical that ""her"" refers to Catherine, as she is the one who has been abducted and would need protection from Grobart.",0,0
2032,Carol looks for Eva and begins to worry when she does not see her.,she,"0: Carol, 1: Eva, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Carol is the subject of the sentence and is performing the action of looking for Eva.
2. The pronoun ""she"" appears in the clause ""when she does not see her.""
3. Logically, Carol is the one who is not seeing someone, as she is the one looking.
4. ""Her"" at the end of the sentence likely refers to Eva, as Carol is looking for Eva.

Given this analysis, ""she"" most likely refers to Carol, as Carol is the one who ""does not see her (Eva)."" It wouldn't make sense for Eva to be the one not seeing, as she is the one being looked for.",0,0
2033,"Most Confederate officers regarded Northern soldiers as inept, but Davis had long defended them.",them,"0: Northern soldiers, 1: Most Confederate officers, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""them"" refers to, let's analyze the sentence:

1. The sentence contrasts two groups: Confederate officers and Northern soldiers.
2. The first part of the sentence states that ""Most Confederate officers regarded Northern soldiers as inept.""
3. The second part, introduced by ""but,"" indicates a contrasting view held by Davis.
4. The pronoun ""them"" is used in this contrasting statement.
5. Logically, ""them"" must refer to the group that was previously described as ""inept"" by the Confederate officers.
6. This group is clearly the ""Northern soldiers.""

Therefore, the pronoun ""them"" refers to the Northern soldiers, which is candidate 0.",0,0
2034,"Nina broke down which frustrated Christina, after being told she can not participate in the sea runway for her lung problem.",she,"0: Nina, 1: Christina, 2: Neither","To determine who ""she"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context:

1. Nina broke down
2. This frustrated Christina
3. Someone was told they can't participate in the sea runway due to a lung problem

The pronoun ""she"" is used in the context of not being able to participate in the sea runway due to a lung problem. This information is presented as the reason for the situation described earlier in the sentence.

Given that Nina broke down, it's more likely that she is the one who received the news about not being able to participate. Christina's reaction (frustration) seems to be in response to Nina's breakdown, rather than her own situation.

Therefore, it's most logical to conclude that ""she"" refers to Nina in this context.",0,0
2035,Hence Meera tells Adhira to go and eat so that she can send the cows and ruin the crops.,she,"0: Meera, 1: Adhira, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to: Meera or Adhira. Let's analyze the context:

1. Meera is telling Adhira to go and eat.
2. The purpose of this action is so that ""she"" can send the cows and ruin the crops.

Given this information, it's more logical that ""she"" refers to Meera for the following reasons:
- Meera is the subject of the main clause, making her the primary actor in the sentence.
- The action of sending cows to ruin crops seems to be Meera's plan, as she's the one telling Adhira to go away (to eat).
- It wouldn't make sense for Adhira to be sent away to eat if she were the one planning to send the cows.

Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Meera in this context.",0,0
2036,"Diana becomes involved with patient Loana Stratton, but she dies.",she,"0: Diana, 1: patient Loana Stratton, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions two female individuals: Diana and Loana Stratton.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""but she dies.""
3. The sentence structure suggests that ""she"" refers to the person who is not Diana, as Diana is the subject of the main clause.
4. Loana Stratton is introduced as a patient, and it's more likely that a patient would die in this context.
5. The use of ""but"" indicates a contrast, suggesting that while Diana becomes involved with Loana, it's Loana who dies.

Based on these points, it's most logical to conclude that ""she"" refers to Loana Stratton, not Diana.",1,1
2037,Hiranyakasipu banished Prahlada but then relented and allowed him to come home.,him,"0: Hiranyakasipu, 1: Prahlada, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""him"" refers to Prahlada. The context indicates that Hiranyakasipu, the subject of the sentence, performed actions towards another person. First, Hiranyakasipu banished Prahlada, and then allowed ""him"" to come home. It's logical that the ""him"" in this case refers to the person who was banished, which is Prahlada. Hiranyakasipu, being the one who made the decisions (to banish and then to allow return), cannot be the referent of ""him"" in this context.",0,1
2038,"John still holds a grudge against Edward, since his departure led to their parents divorce.",his,"0: John, 1: Edward, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""his"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence mentions two people: John and Edward.
2. The pronoun ""his"" is used in the phrase ""his departure.""
3. The sentence implies that someone's departure led to their parents' divorce.
4. John is described as holding a grudge against Edward.

Given this information, it's more logical that ""his"" refers to Edward rather than John. The sentence structure suggests that Edward's departure is the cause of John's grudge and the parents' divorce. If ""his"" referred to John, it wouldn't make sense for John to hold a grudge against Edward for John's own departure.

Therefore, the pronoun ""his"" most likely refers to Edward.",1,1
2039,Cheryl shoots Elizabeth dead when she discovers the truth about the abuse.,she,"0: Cheryl, 1: Elizabeth, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Cheryl. The sentence structure suggests that Cheryl is the subject performing the action of shooting Elizabeth. The pronoun ""she"" is used to describe the person who ""discovers the truth about the abuse,"" which logically follows that Cheryl is the one making this discovery and then taking action based on it. Elizabeth, being the object of the sentence (the one who is shot), is less likely to be the referent of ""she"" in this context.",0,0
2040,Aabidah tries to help Naseema when she understands what state of affairs they are currently in.,she,"0: Aabidah, 1: Naseema, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Aabidah tries to help Naseema.""
2. This is followed by ""when she understands...""

The pronoun ""she"" is more likely to refer to Aabidah for the following reasons:
1. Aabidah is the subject of the main clause and is performing the action of trying to help.
2. It's more logical that Aabidah would try to help Naseema when Aabidah understands the situation, rather than when Naseema understands it.
3. If ""she"" referred to Naseema, the sentence would imply that Aabidah helps Naseema when Naseema understands the situation, which is less likely given the sentence structure.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Aabidah.",0,0
2041,"Mary attempts to kiss Susanna, but she moves away, which makes her become even more upset.",she,"0: Mary, 1: Susanna, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""she"" refers to. Let's break it down:

1. ""Mary attempts to kiss Susanna"" - This establishes the initial action.
2. ""but she moves away"" - This is the first use of ""she,"" and it refers to the person who moves away.
3. ""which makes her become even more upset"" - This is the second use of ""her,"" referring to the person who becomes upset.

Given the context, it's more logical that Susanna would be the one moving away from Mary's attempt to kiss her. Therefore, the first ""she"" refers to Susanna.

The second ""her"" (in ""makes her become even more upset"") likely refers to Mary, as she would be the one upset by Susanna moving away from her kiss attempt. However, we're specifically asked about the pronoun ""she,"" which in this case refers to Susanna.",1,1
2042,But the dissatisfaction Jean had sensed in Ryan manifests when he hangs himself in the same house he had shared with the changelings years before.,he,"0: Ryan, 1: Jean, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" clearly refers to Ryan. The context indicates that Ryan is the one who hangs himself, not Jean. The sentence describes Ryan's dissatisfaction that Jean had sensed, which ultimately leads to Ryan's suicide. Jean is mentioned as the one who sensed Ryan's dissatisfaction, but is not the subject of the action (hanging). Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" must refer to Ryan.",0,0
2043,"Sheryl is forced to take care of Amy when she gets sick, thanks to a special clause she built into their Relationship Agreement.",she,"0: Sheryl, 1: Amy, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""she"" the pronoun refers to. There are two instances of ""she"" in the sentence:

1. ""...when she gets sick...""
2. ""...thanks to a special clause she built...""

For the first ""she,"" it's clear that it refers to Amy because Sheryl is taking care of Amy when Amy gets sick.

For the second ""she,"" it logically refers to Sheryl because she is the one who built the special clause into the Relationship Agreement. It wouldn't make sense for Amy to build a clause that forces Sheryl to take care of her.

Since the question asks about the pronoun ""she"" without specifying which instance, and both instances refer to different people, we cannot definitively choose between Sheryl and Amy. Therefore, the appropriate answer is ""Neither.""",1,2
2044,"The Norwegian begged the King to refuse, but he would not break his word and gave orders to proceed.",he,"0: The Norwegian, 1: the King, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine whether the pronoun ""he"" refers to the Norwegian or the King. Let's analyze the context:

1. The Norwegian is mentioned first, begging the King to refuse something.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the second part of the sentence, referring to someone who ""would not break his word and gave orders to proceed.""

Given this context, it's more likely that ""he"" refers to the King for the following reasons:
- The King is in a position of authority to give orders.
- The phrase ""would not break his word"" implies a decision made by someone in power, which aligns more with the King's role.
- The Norwegian is described as begging the King to refuse, which suggests that the King had made a prior commitment or decision that he was unwilling to change.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to the King.",1,1

The sentence is describing why Jean is acting out, and the pronoun ""he"" is used in direct reference to Jean's experience of being molested as a child.

2046,Lena Schrute makes Angela Lipton jealous when she starts dating a Brussels sprout farmer.,she,"0: Lena Schrute, 1: Angela Lipton, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions two female characters: Lena Schrute and Angela Lipton.
2. The pronoun ""she"" appears in the clause ""when she starts dating a Brussels sprout farmer.""
3. The main subject of the sentence is Lena Schrute, who is described as making Angela Lipton jealous.
4. It's more logical that Lena Schrute is the one dating the Brussels sprout farmer, which is causing Angela Lipton to be jealous.

Based on this analysis, it's most likely that ""she"" refers to Lena Schrute, as she is the main subject of the sentence and the one whose actions are causing Angela's jealousy.",1,0
2047,"Whitey suspects that an associate who overhears the murder plan, Brian Halloran is untrustworthy, so he pays him off to leave the meeting.",he,"0: Whitey, 1: Brian Halloran, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Whitey. The reasoning is as follows:

1. The sentence begins with ""Whitey suspects,"" establishing Whitey as the main subject of the sentence.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the latter part of the sentence to describe an action (paying off Brian Halloran).
3. This action is consistent with Whitey's initial suspicion about Brian Halloran being untrustworthy.
4. It wouldn't make sense for Brian Halloran to pay himself off to leave the meeting.

Therefore, ""he"" in this context clearly refers to Whitey, who is taking action based on his suspicions about Brian Halloran.",1,0
2048,"Martin sexually harasses Clement and when he accuses him of victimisation, he is left alienated at work.",he,"0: Martin, 1: Clement, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. ""Martin sexually harasses Clement"" - This establishes Martin as the harasser and Clement as the victim.

2. ""and when he accuses him of victimisation"" - Here, we need to determine who ""he"" refers to. Given the context, it's more likely that Clement (the victim) would accuse Martin (the harasser) of victimization, not the other way around. So ""he"" in this part likely refers to Clement.

3. ""he is left alienated at work"" - This ""he"" is likely referring to the same person as in the previous clause, which we determined to be Clement. It makes sense that after accusing someone of sexual harassment, that person (Clement) might feel alienated at work.

Therefore, both instances of ""he"" in this sentence most likely refer to Clement.",1,1
2049,"Erica then turns up to talk to Steph, but she runs off.",she,"0: Erica, 1: Steph, 2: Neither","To determine who ""she"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and the actions described:

1. Erica turns up to talk to Steph.
2. ""She"" runs off.

The pronoun ""she"" is more likely to refer to Steph for the following reasons:

1. Erica is described as the one who ""turns up to talk to Steph,"" which implies that Erica is the one initiating the interaction.
2. The action of running off is more likely to be performed by the person being approached (Steph) rather than the person initiating the interaction (Erica).
3. It's more logical for Steph to run off if she doesn't want to talk to Erica, rather than Erica running off after coming to talk to Steph.

Therefore, based on the context and the flow of actions, ""she"" most likely refers to Steph.",1,1
2050,"Ewan confronts Mona but, through a failure of communication, she admits that she has feelings for Dan.",she,"0: Ewan, 1: Mona, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" clearly refers to Mona. The sentence structure indicates that Ewan is confronting Mona, and then ""she"" (Mona) admits to having feelings for Dan. The pronoun ""she"" is used to avoid repeating Mona's name in the second part of the sentence. It wouldn't make sense for ""she"" to refer to Ewan, as Ewan is referred to with male pronouns (as evidenced by the name Ewan, which is typically a male name). Therefore, the correct answer is 1, referring to Mona.",1,1
2051,"Daniela is also enchanted by Nina, but her heart still beats strong for Almerinda.",her,"0: Daniela, 1: Nina, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""her"" refers to, let's analyze the sentence:

""Daniela is also enchanted by Nina, but her heart still beats strong for Almerinda.""

The pronoun ""her"" is used in the second part of the sentence, which talks about a heart beating strong for Almerinda. This implies that the person whose heart is being referred to has romantic feelings for Almerinda.

Given the context, it's more likely that Daniela is the one who has feelings for Almerinda. The sentence structure suggests that we're primarily talking about Daniela's feelings: first, her enchantment with Nina, and then, despite that, her stronger feelings for Almerinda.

Nina is mentioned as the object of Daniela's enchantment, but there's no indication that Nina has feelings for Almerinda.

Therefore, ""her"" most likely refers to Daniela.",0,0

1. The sentence starts with ""Cristian waits for Joey,"" establishing that Cristian is the subject and Joey is the object of the waiting action.

2. The second part of the sentence, ""but he goes to the rooftop cocktail party instead,"" introduces a contrasting action.

3. The use of ""but"" suggests that the person going to the party is not the one who was waiting, as it's presented as an alternative action.

4. Since Cristian was waiting for Joey, and ""he"" goes to the party instead, it's more likely that ""he"" refers to Joey.

5. The action of going to the party instead of meeting Cristian aligns more logically with Joey's behavior, as he was the one being waited for.

Based on this analysis, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Joey.",1,1
2053,"Mary tries to stab Abigail, but she evades her and kicks the knife from her hand.",she,"0: Mary, 1: Abigail, 2: Neither","Let's analyze the sentence step by step:

1. ""Mary tries to stab Abigail"" - This sets up the initial action, with Mary as the aggressor and Abigail as the target.

2. ""but she evades her"" - This is where the pronoun ""she"" appears. In this context, ""she"" must refer to the person being attacked, which is Abigail. The verb ""evades"" indicates that this person is avoiding the attack.

3. ""and kicks the knife from her hand"" - This further confirms that ""she"" refers to Abigail, as this action is a continuation of the defense against Mary's attack.

The pronoun ""she"" in this sentence clearly refers to Abigail, as she is the one performing the actions of evading and kicking in response to Mary's attempt to stab her.",1,1
2054,Madison has a short attraction to Matilda but she rebuffs her.,she,"0: Madison, 1: Matilda, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Madison has a short attraction to Matilda.
2. ""She"" rebuffs ""her"".

The pronoun ""she"" is the subject of the verb ""rebuffs"", which means to reject or refuse. Given the context, it's more likely that Matilda is the one doing the rebuffing, as Madison is described as having an attraction to Matilda.

Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Matilda, who is rebuffing Madison's attraction.",1,1
2055,"Molly asks Tamara to sing, but her society friends do not think much of her singing.",her,"0: Molly, 1: Tamara, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""her"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence mentions two people: Molly and Tamara.
2. Molly asks Tamara to sing.
3. The pronoun ""her"" appears twice in the latter part of the sentence.

Let's examine each instance of ""her"":

1. ""her society friends"" - This likely refers to Molly, as she is the one asking Tamara to sing, implying that Molly has friends present.
2. ""her singing"" - This most likely refers to Tamara, as she is the one being asked to sing.

Since we're asked to choose one referent for ""her,"" we need to decide which instance is more significant in the context. The main action of the sentence is about Tamara's singing and how it's perceived. Therefore, the more prominent and relevant use of ""her"" in this sentence refers to Tamara.",0,1
2056,Linda tries to apologize to Nova but she turns her back on her.,she,"0: Linda, 1: Nova, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Linda is trying to apologize to Nova.
2. ""She"" turns her back on ""her"".

Given this information, it's more likely that ""she"" refers to Nova because:
- Linda is the one apologizing, which implies she's facing Nova or trying to engage with her.
- The action of turning one's back is typically a response to someone's attempt at communication or interaction.
- It makes more sense for Nova to turn her back on Linda (the one apologizing) rather than Linda turning her back on Nova while trying to apologize.

Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Nova in this context.",1,1
2057,"Megan accidentally fires a shot that injures Barbara, but she shoots Larry dead.",she,"0: Megan, 1: Barbara, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Megan accidentally fires a shot that injures Barbara.
2. ""She"" shoots Larry dead.

The pronoun ""she"" is more likely to refer to Megan for the following reasons:
1. Megan is the subject of the first clause and the main actor in the sentence.
2. The action of shooting Larry dead seems to be a continuation of Megan's actions, even though the first shot was accidental.
3. Barbara is mentioned as the victim of the first shot, making it less likely that she would then shoot Larry.

Therefore, based on the context and the flow of actions, ""she"" most likely refers to Megan.",0,0
2058,Jessica is delighted when Chloe finally arrives but she announces to her that she'll be leaving Geordie Shore forever.,she,"0: Jessica, 1: Chloe, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""she"" refers to Jessica or Chloe. Let's break it down:

1. The first ""she"" in the sentence: ""...but she announces to her...""
   This ""she"" is likely referring to Chloe because:
   - Jessica is already present and delighted when Chloe arrives.
   - It would make more sense for the newly arrived person (Chloe) to make an announcement.

2. The second ""she"" in the sentence: ""...that she'll be leaving...""
   This ""she"" is also likely referring to Chloe because:
   - It's a continuation of the same announcement.
   - It would be odd for Jessica to announce that she (Jessica) is leaving right when Chloe arrives.

Given this analysis, both instances of ""she"" in the sentence appear to refer to Chloe.",0,1
2059,Mia attempts to train Jenna up so she looks good for her interview and the pair get closer.,she,"0: Mia, 1: Jenna, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Jenna for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure suggests that Mia is the one doing the training, while Jenna is the one being trained.
2. The purpose of the training is stated as ""so she looks good for her interview,"" which implies that the person being referred to by ""she"" is the one who has an upcoming interview.
3. It's more logical that Jenna would be the one preparing for an interview, as Mia is already in a position to train her.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" in this context is most likely referring to Jenna (candidate 1).",1,1
2060,"The mason had no idea of what the apostle looked like, so he used his fellow villagers as models.",he,"0: the apostle, 1: The mason, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to ""The mason"" for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure indicates that the subject (The mason) is the one performing the action (using fellow villagers as models).
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the same clause as the action being described, which is logically connected to the mason's lack of knowledge about the apostle's appearance.
3. It wouldn't make sense for ""he"" to refer to the apostle, as the apostle is not the one using villagers as models.
4. The mason is the main subject of the sentence, and pronouns typically refer to the most recently mentioned subject that agrees in gender and number.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to ""The mason"" (candidate 1).",1,1
2061,"Baby warns Nick that if he can not prove his innocence, he will have to be killed.",he,"0: Baby, 1: Nick, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""he"" refers to: Baby or Nick. Let's analyze the context:

1. Baby is warning Nick about something.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the conditional clause ""if he can not prove his innocence.""
3. The consequence of not proving innocence is ""he will have to be killed.""

Given this context, it's clear that Baby is warning Nick about Nick's own situation. It wouldn't make sense for Baby to be warning Nick about Baby's own innocence or potential death. Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" in this sentence refers to Nick.",1,1
2062,"Santiago has feelings for Jose Manuel, but he can not dare tell him about them.",he,"0: Santiago, 1: Jose Manuel, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Santiago is mentioned first, establishing him as the primary subject.
2. The sentence states that Santiago has feelings for Jose Manuel.
3. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""he can not dare tell him about them.""
4. The use of ""him"" later in the sentence likely refers to Jose Manuel, as Santiago wouldn't need to tell himself about his own feelings.

Given this analysis, it's most logical that ""he"" refers to Santiago. Santiago is the one with feelings, and he is the one who can't dare to tell Jose Manuel about these feelings. This interpretation maintains the coherence of the sentence and aligns with the typical structure of such statements.",0,0
2063,"Santiago comes back with an attempt to win Jose Manuel back, but he is only faced by rejection.",he,"0: Santiago, 1: Jose Manuel, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who the pronoun ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Santiago is the subject of the first part of the sentence, performing the action of coming back.
2. The second part of the sentence, after ""but,"" introduces a new situation.
3. The pronoun ""he"" is used in this second part, indicating a shift in focus.
4. The phrase ""is only faced by rejection"" suggests that the person referred to by ""he"" is the one experiencing rejection.

Given this analysis, it's more likely that ""he"" refers to Santiago. Santiago is the one who comes back with an attempt to win Jose Manuel back, and it makes sense that Santiago would be the one facing rejection as a result of this attempt.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Santiago.",0,0
2064,Diana becomes jealous of Erica when she finds out she has a date to the Sadie Hawkins dance which she will be chaperoning.,she,"0: Diana, 1: Erica, 2: Neither","In this sentence, there are multiple instances of the pronoun 'she', and we need to determine which one refers to Diana or Erica. Let's break it down:

1. 'Diana becomes jealous of Erica when she finds out' - This 'she' likely refers to Diana, as she is the subject of the sentence and the one experiencing jealousy.
2. 'she has a date' - This 'she' refers to Erica, as Diana is jealous of Erica having a date.
3. 'which she will be chaperoning' - This 'she' refers back to Diana, as it's more likely that Diana (being jealous and presumably older) would be chaperoning the dance.

The question asks about the pronoun 'she' without specifying which instance, so we need to consider all of them. Since 'she' refers to both Diana and Erica at different points in the sentence, we cannot definitively choose one over the other.",0,2
2065,"Moreover, Severo will attempt to conquer Franco, but he is married to Virginia who is a model of a perfect housewife.",he,"0: Franco, 1: Severo, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions two male characters: Severo and Franco.
2. The pronoun ""he"" appears in the clause ""he is married to Virginia.""
3. The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" refers to the subject of the previous clause, which is Severo.
4. Logically, it makes more sense that the person attempting to conquer (Severo) is the one being described as married, rather than the person being conquered (Franco).

Based on these observations, it is most likely that ""he"" refers to Severo.",1,1
2066,"Charlotte decides to write to Diana to find out more, since she was present at the killings of the Shades.",she,"0: Charlotte, 1: Diana, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions two people: Charlotte and Diana.
2. The pronoun ""she"" appears in the clause ""since she was present at the killings of the Shades.""
3. The main action of the sentence is Charlotte deciding to write to Diana.
4. The reason for writing is to find out more information.
5. The clause with ""she"" provides the reason why Diana would have this information.

Based on this analysis, it's clear that ""she"" refers to Diana. Charlotte is writing to Diana because Diana was present at the killings of the Shades, not Charlotte herself. If ""she"" referred to Charlotte, there would be no reason for Charlotte to write to Diana for information.",1,1
2067,Lily does not want Dorothy to leave because she likes her.,she,"0: Lily, 1: Dorothy, 2: Neither","To determine who ""she"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and the logical flow of the statement.

The sentence states that ""Lily does not want Dorothy to leave because she likes her."" The pronoun ""she"" is used in the explanation of why Lily doesn't want Dorothy to leave.

It's more logical and natural to interpret this as Lily being the one who likes Dorothy, rather than Dorothy liking herself. The sentence is explaining Lily's motivation for not wanting Dorothy to leave, so ""she"" most likely refers to Lily.

If ""she"" referred to Dorothy, the sentence would imply that Dorothy likes herself, which doesn't provide a clear reason for Lily not wanting Dorothy to leave.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Lily (candidate 0).",0,0
2068,"Jessica takes Gloria to sleep, but when she returns, everyone else has gone.",she,"0: Jessica, 1: Gloria, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the clause ""when she returns,"" which implies that this person left and came back. 

Looking at the context:
1. Jessica takes Gloria to sleep - This indicates that Jessica is the one who left to take Gloria somewhere.
2. ""but when she returns"" - This suggests that the person who left is now coming back.

Given this information, it's most logical that ""she"" refers to Jessica. Jessica is the one who took Gloria to sleep, so she would be the one returning.

Gloria is less likely to be the referent because she was taken to sleep, implying she stayed where she was put to sleep.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Jessica.",0,0
2069,"Sister Pete insists on counselling Dr. Margaret, but she ultimately suffers a mental breakdown.",she,"0: Dr. Margaret, 1: Sister Pete, 2: Neither","To determine who the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions two people: Sister Pete and Dr. Margaret.
2. The first part of the sentence states that ""Sister Pete insists on counselling Dr. Margaret.""
3. The second part, connected by ""but,"" introduces a contrasting event: ""she ultimately suffers a mental breakdown.""

Given this structure, it's more likely that ""she"" refers to Dr. Margaret for the following reasons:
- The sentence sets up a situation where Sister Pete is counselling Dr. Margaret.
- The use of ""but"" suggests a unexpected or contrasting outcome to this counselling.
- It would be more logical for the person receiving counselling (Dr. Margaret) to suffer a mental breakdown, rather than the person providing the counselling (Sister Pete).

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Dr. Margaret.",1,0
2070,"British actor John Cleese was signed up for the role of Michael Simpson, but due to heart problems he was unable to perform in the film.",he,"0: Michael Simpson, 1: British actor John Cleese, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to John Cleese. The sentence structure indicates that John Cleese was initially signed up for a role, but then couldn't perform due to health issues. The pronoun ""he"" is used to avoid repeating John Cleese's name in the second part of the sentence. It's clear that the health problems (heart problems) are associated with John Cleese, not Michael Simpson, as it's John Cleese who was unable to perform in the film.",0,1
2071,"Ricardo does n't have feelings for Lucas, but he has never abandoned him.",he,"0: Ricardo, 1: Lucas, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Ricardo doesn't have feelings for Lucas""
2. Then it continues with ""but he has never abandoned him""

The pronoun ""he"" is more likely to refer to Ricardo because:
1. Ricardo is the subject of the first clause and the main actor in the sentence.
2. The sentence structure suggests a contrast between Ricardo's lack of feelings and his actions (not abandoning Lucas).
3. It would be less logical for Lucas to be the one not abandoning Ricardo in this context.

Therefore, ""he"" most likely refers to Ricardo.",0,0
2072,"Rosalie tries to win back Kate, but she turns her down.",she,"0: Rosalie, 1: Kate, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which person the pronoun ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Rosalie is the subject of the first clause, trying to win back Kate.
2. The second clause starts with ""but she turns her down.""
3. The pronoun ""she"" in the second clause is performing the action of turning someone down.
4. Logically, it makes sense that Kate would be the one turning Rosalie down, as Rosalie is trying to win Kate back.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" in this context most likely refers to Kate, who is turning Rosalie down.",1,1
2073,"Liz has been trying to go slow with Marilyn, but she gives in to her passion and they spend the night together.",she,"0: Liz, 1: Marilyn, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Liz for the following reasons:

1. Liz is mentioned first in the sentence, making her the primary subject.
2. The sentence structure suggests that Liz is the one who has been trying to ""go slow"" with Marilyn.
3. The phrase ""she gives in to her passion"" implies that the subject (Liz) is the one who has been restraining herself and now gives in.

While it's possible that ""she"" could refer to Marilyn, the context and sentence structure make it more likely that Liz is the one giving in to her passion. The sentence is describing Liz's actions and feelings towards Marilyn.",0,0
2074,"Briella frantically attempts to warn Jill, but she is kidnapped by Chord.",she,"0: Briella, 1: Jill, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun 'she' most likely refers to Jill. The sentence structure suggests that Briella is trying to warn Jill about something, but before the warning can be completed, someone (Jill) is kidnapped by Chord. It wouldn't make sense for Briella to be kidnapped while she's in the act of warning Jill. The pronoun 'she' is used to avoid repeating Jill's name in the second part of the sentence.",1,1
2075,John tried to challenge Maxim but he wanted nothing to do with him.,he,"0: Maxim, 1: John, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. John is the subject of the first part of the sentence, initiating the action of trying to challenge Maxim.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the second part of the sentence, describing someone who ""wanted nothing to do with him.""
3. Given the structure of the sentence, it's more likely that ""he"" refers to Maxim rather than John. This is because:
   a) It would be redundant for John to not want anything to do with himself.
   b) The sentence implies a contrast between John's action (trying to challenge) and the other person's reaction (wanting nothing to do with it).
4. The phrase ""wanted nothing to do with him"" suggests that Maxim is rejecting or avoiding John's challenge.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Maxim in this context.",0,0
2076,"Joaquin begins dating Lucas, but grows insecure after he begins to experience some success.",he,"0: Joaquin, 1: Lucas, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""he"" refers to. The pronoun ""he"" appears in the second part of the sentence, which states ""but grows insecure after he begins to experience some success."" 

To identify who ""he"" refers to, we need to consider the context and the logical flow of the sentence:

1. The sentence starts with ""Joaquin begins dating Lucas.""
2. Then it mentions that someone grows insecure.
3. This insecurity is triggered by ""he"" experiencing some success.

Given this information, it's more likely that ""he"" refers to Lucas rather than Joaquin. The sentence implies that Joaquin becomes insecure because of Lucas's success. If ""he"" referred to Joaquin, it wouldn't make sense for Joaquin to become insecure due to his own success.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Lucas.",1,1
2077,Maira meanwhile is angry with Adhira so Bari Sarkar consoles her.,her,"0: Maira, 1: Adhira, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""her"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence mentions two female characters: Maira and Adhira.
2. The pronoun ""her"" appears at the end of the sentence.
3. The sentence structure indicates that Bari Sarkar is consoling someone.
4. The person being consoled is likely the one who is angry.
5. The sentence states that ""Maira meanwhile is angry with Adhira.""

Based on this analysis, we can conclude that Maira is the one who is angry, and therefore, she is the one being consoled by Bari Sarkar. The pronoun ""her"" at the end of the sentence refers to Maira.",0,0
2078,"Naomie attempts to apologize to Jill, but she becomes more angry with her fumbled apology.",she,"0: Naomie, 1: Jill, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Naomie is attempting to apologize to Jill.
2. ""She"" becomes more angry with her fumbled apology.

Given this information, it's more likely that ""she"" refers to Jill for the following reasons:
- Jill is the recipient of the apology.
- It's more logical for the person receiving an apology to become angry if it's fumbled, rather than the person giving the apology.
- The phrase ""more angry"" suggests that Jill was already angry, and the fumbled apology made it worse.

Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Jill in this context.",1,1
2079,Anika works hard to save Venu so as not to create a misconception that she killed Venu in order to be with Seetha.,she,"0: Anika, 1: Venu, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" clearly refers to Anika for the following reasons:

1. Anika is the subject of the sentence and the main actor in the described situation.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the context of someone who could potentially be accused of killing Venu, which aligns with Anika's position in the sentence.
3. The sentence structure suggests that Anika is the one trying to prevent a misconception about herself.
4. Venu is referred to by name in the latter part of the sentence, indicating that ""she"" is not referring to Venu.
5. The context implies that Anika is a female character, matching the feminine pronoun ""she.""

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most logically refers to Anika (candidate 0).",1,0
2080,"John goes out to kill Tony, but he ambushes and bites him.",he,"0: John, 1: Tony, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. John is the subject of the first clause, indicating he's the one going out to kill Tony.
2. The second clause starts with ""but,"" suggesting a contrast or unexpected turn of events.
3. The actions in the second clause are ""ambushes"" and ""bites.""

Given this information, it's more likely that ""he"" refers to Tony rather than John. The sentence implies that John's initial plan to kill Tony was thwarted because Tony ambushed and bit John instead. This interpretation makes the most sense given the contrasting conjunction ""but"" and the unexpected turn of events.

Therefore, ""he"" most likely refers to Tony (candidate 1).",1,1
2081,Adimarchus would have killed Athux but in a rare moment of compassion sparked by his celestial nature could not bear to do it.,his,"0: Adimarchus, 1: Athux, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""his"" refers to Adimarchus. The reasoning is as follows:

1. The sentence is describing a situation where Adimarchus is the main actor, and Athux is the potential victim.
2. The phrase ""in a rare moment of compassion"" suggests a change or exception in Adimarchus's behavior.
3. The ""celestial nature"" is attributed to the subject of the sentence, which is Adimarchus.
4. The pronoun ""his"" is used in relation to this celestial nature, connecting it directly to Adimarchus.

Therefore, ""his"" in this context refers to Adimarchus's celestial nature, which prevented him from killing Athux.",0,0
2082,"When Saul realizes where Javadi is going, he immediately sends Carrie and Quinn there to intercept him.",he,"0: Saul, 1: Javadi, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" clearly refers to Saul. The sentence structure indicates that Saul is the subject who realizes something and then takes action based on that realization. The pronoun ""he"" is used to avoid repeating Saul's name in the same sentence. Javadi is the object of Saul's actions, not the one performing them. Therefore, ""he"" must refer to Saul.",0,0
2083,Saul wonders why Javadi was there when he was supposed to be under witness protection in California.,he,"0: Saul, 1: Javadi, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Javadi, not Saul. The reasoning is as follows:

1. The sentence structure indicates that Saul is wondering about Javadi's presence.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""when he was supposed to be under witness protection in California.""
3. It wouldn't make sense for Saul to wonder about his own presence or his own witness protection status.
4. The logical interpretation is that Javadi was the one who was supposed to be under witness protection in California.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Javadi (candidate 1).",1,1
2084,Laila grows closer to Cora when she holds her a late birthday celebration as everyone forgets the date.,she,"0: Laila, 1: Cora, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Laila grows closer to Cora...""
2. The pronoun ""she"" appears in the phrase ""...when she holds her a late birthday celebration...""
3. The action of holding a birthday celebration is more likely to be performed by someone for another person, rather than for themselves.
4. The sentence implies that Laila is the one growing closer to Cora, suggesting that Laila is doing something for Cora.

Based on this analysis, it's more logical that Laila is the one holding the birthday celebration for Cora. Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Laila.",0,0
2085,"Later, Julia attempts to talk to Sylvie, but she ignores her.",she,"0: Sylvie, 1: Julia, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Julia is the subject of the sentence, attempting to talk to Sylvie.
2. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the second part of the sentence.
3. The action associated with ""she"" is ignoring ""her.""

Given this information, it's more likely that ""she"" refers to Sylvie rather than Julia. This is because:

1. It wouldn't make sense for Julia to ignore herself.
2. The natural flow of the sentence suggests that Sylvie is the one ignoring Julia's attempt to talk.

Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Sylvie, who is ignoring Julia's attempt to communicate.",0,0
2086,Victoria tries to tell Elena but stops when she tells her that she has lost Stefan and she decides to help her find him.,she,"0: Victoria, 1: Elena, 2: Neither","In this sentence, there are two instances of 'she' that we need to consider. The first 'she' in 'she tells her' clearly refers to Elena, as Victoria is trying to tell Elena something. The second 'she' in 'she has lost Stefan' also refers to Elena, as it's Elena who has lost Stefan. The third 'she' in 'she decides to help her' refers back to Victoria, as Victoria is the one deciding to help Elena. Since the question asks about 'she' without specifying which instance, and two out of three instances refer to Elena, it's most likely that the pronoun 'she' generally refers to Elena in this context.",1,1
2087,"Rosetti's men soon come after Nucky himself, but he escapes and seeks protection from Northside leader Chalky White.",he,"0: Rosetti 's men, 1: Nucky, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" clearly refers to Nucky. The context indicates that Rosetti's men are coming after Nucky, and then ""he"" (Nucky) escapes and seeks protection. The actions of escaping and seeking protection are logically associated with the person being pursued, which is Nucky in this case. Rosetti's men are mentioned as a group, so ""he"" cannot refer to them. There are no other individuals mentioned in the text that could be referred to by ""he"".",1,1
2088,"Bailey decides to pull out of the interview for space camp for Geoffrey, but he talks him out of it.",he,"0: Bailey, 1: Geoffrey, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""he"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Bailey decides to pull out of the interview for space camp for Geoffrey.
2. But ""he"" talks him out of it.

The pronoun ""he"" is performing the action of talking someone out of something. Given the context, it's more likely that Geoffrey is the one talking Bailey out of pulling out of the interview. This is because:

1. Bailey is the one who initially decides to pull out of the interview.
2. The interview is for Geoffrey's benefit (for space camp for Geoffrey).
3. It would make more sense for Geoffrey to convince Bailey not to pull out, rather than Bailey convincing himself.

Therefore, ""he"" most likely refers to Geoffrey in this context.",1,1
2089,"Emery is even forced to satisfy Ashok's client, but he refuses.",he,"0: Emery, 1: Ashok 's client, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Emery. The sentence structure suggests that Emery is the subject who is being forced to do something, and then ""he"" is the one who refuses.

The sentence doesn't provide any indication that Ashok's client is refusing anything. Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" is most logically referring to Emery.",0,0

1. The sentence introduces two female characters: Defense attorney Kate and Emma Gwynek.
2. The pronoun ""she"" appears in the clause ""after she is charged with the murders of a vacationing family.""
3. It's more logical that Emma Gwynek would be charged with murders rather than the defense attorney Kate.
4. The sentence structure suggests that Kate is called to defend Emma, implying that Emma is the one being charged.

Based on this analysis, it's clear that ""she"" refers to Emma Gwynek, not Kate.",1,1
2091,"Bob is on the committee trying to force out Coach O'Hara, but he likes the coach's daughter Janet.",he,"0: Bob, 1: Coach O'Hara, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Bob. We can determine this for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure places ""Bob"" as the subject of the first clause, making him the most likely antecedent for subsequent pronouns.

2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the second part of the sentence to describe an action (liking the coach's daughter) that contrasts with the action in the first part (trying to force out the coach). This contrast suggests that ""he"" refers to the person mentioned in the first part, which is Bob.

3. It wouldn't make sense for ""he"" to refer to Coach O'Hara, as the coach wouldn't be trying to force himself out.

4. The sentence is describing Bob's conflicting feelings: he's part of the committee trying to remove the coach, but he also likes the coach's daughter. This internal conflict is centered on Bob, not Coach O'Hara.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Bob.",0,0
2092,"Rita is afraid that Katie is going to be poisoned, but before she can warn her, she is struck down by a speeding car.",she,"0: Rita, 1: Katie, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which ""she"" the pronoun refers to. There are two instances of ""she"" in the sentence, and we need to analyze the context to determine which one refers to which character.

1. The first ""she"" appears in ""before she can warn her"". This ""she"" is likely referring to Rita, as Rita is the one who is afraid and would be the one trying to warn Katie.

2. The second ""she"" appears in ""she is struck down by a speeding car"". This ""she"" could refer to either Rita or Katie, as the sentence doesn't provide clear information about who gets struck by the car.

Given that the question asks about the pronoun ""she"" without specifying which instance, and considering that the first ""she"" more clearly refers to Rita, it's most reasonable to conclude that the pronoun ""she"" in this context refers to Rita.",0,0
2093,Rita is particularly unhinged and fantasizes about having left Esther alive so she could torture her.,she,"0: Rita, 1: Esther, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Rita is described as ""particularly unhinged"" and is the subject of the sentence.
2. Rita is fantasizing about a scenario involving Esther.
3. The pronoun ""she"" is used in the phrase ""so she could torture her.""

Given this context, it's clear that Rita is the one who would be doing the torturing in this fantasy scenario. Therefore, ""she"" refers to Rita, not Esther.",0,0
2094,"Federer would have a speedy dispatch of Canadian wildcard Peter Polansky, advancing to the round of sixteen where he defeated Marin Cilic in a three set thriller match.",he,"0: Federer, 1: Canadian wildcard Peter Polansky, 2: Neither","The pronoun ""he"" in this context refers to Federer for the following reasons:

1. Federer is the main subject of the sentence and the paragraph.
2. The sentence structure indicates that Federer is the one who advanced to the round of sixteen.
3. The pronoun ""he"" is used in relation to defeating Marin Cilic, which is more likely to be an action performed by Federer, a top-ranked player, rather than Peter Polansky, who is described as a wildcard.
4. The flow of the text suggests that we are following Federer's progress through the tournament, from dispatching Polansky to defeating Cilic.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Federer.",0,0
2095,"Yvonne finally agrees to marry Romaisa, but she remains indifferent to her.",she,"0: Yvonne, 1: Romaisa, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Yvonne agrees to marry Romaisa.
2. ""She"" remains indifferent to ""her"".

The pronoun ""she"" is more likely to refer to Yvonne for the following reasons:
1. Yvonne is the subject of the first clause, making her the more prominent character in the sentence.
2. It's more natural to describe the feelings of the person who agreed to marry (Yvonne) rather than the person being married (Romaisa).
3. The use of ""her"" at the end of the sentence suggests that ""she"" refers to a different person, likely Yvonne being indifferent to Romaisa.

Therefore, ""she"" most likely refers to Yvonne in this context.",0,0
2096,"Morgane predicted Tamara educational path, but at heart she dreamed of something else.",she,"0: Morgane, 1: Tamara, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the context of the sentence:

1. The sentence mentions two people: Morgane and Tamara.
2. The first part of the sentence states that ""Morgane predicted Tamara educational path.""
3. The second part of the sentence, connected by ""but,"" introduces a contrasting idea: ""at heart she dreamed of something else.""

The pronoun ""she"" is more likely to refer to Tamara for the following reasons:
1. Tamara is the object of the first clause and the most recently mentioned person, making her the more likely subject of the following clause.
2. The contrast introduced by ""but"" suggests a shift in focus from Morgane's prediction to Tamara's own desires.
3. It would be more natural for Tamara to dream of something different from the educational path Morgane predicted for her, rather than Morgane dreaming of something different from her own prediction.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Tamara.",1,
2097,"Tyler finds Robbo Slade unconscious, after he was involved in a hit-and-run.",he,"0: Tyler, 1: Robbo Slade, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun 'he' most likely refers to Robbo Slade. The sentence structure suggests that Robbo Slade was the one involved in the hit-and-run, which resulted in him being unconscious. Tyler is described as finding Robbo Slade, implying that Tyler is conscious and active, while Robbo Slade is the one who is unconscious and was involved in the incident.",1,1
2098,"Tyler is interested in Daniel, but he rejects him.",he,"0: Tyler, 1: Daniel, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Tyler is interested in Daniel"".
2. The second part of the sentence uses ""he"" as the subject who rejects someone.
3. The pronoun ""him"" at the end of the sentence refers to the person being rejected.

Given this structure, it's more likely that ""he"" refers to Daniel because:
- If ""he"" referred to Tyler, the sentence would imply Tyler is rejecting himself, which doesn't make logical sense.
- It's more natural for the sentence to mean that Daniel is rejecting Tyler's interest.

Therefore, ""he"" most likely refers to Daniel, who is rejecting Tyler's interest.",1,1
2099,Bonnie is still a little freaked out about being attacked by Ashley but she is grateful to Stefan who saved her life.,she,"0: Bonnie, 1: Ashley, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Bonnie for the following reasons:

1. Bonnie is the subject of the first part of the sentence and is mentioned first, making her the most prominent character.
2. The sentence structure suggests that ""she"" is the same person who is ""still a little freaked out about being attacked.""
3. It would make more sense for Bonnie to be grateful to Stefan for saving her life, as she was the one who was attacked.
4. Ashley is mentioned as the attacker, so it's unlikely that ""she"" would refer to Ashley in this context.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Bonnie (candidate 0).",0,0
2100,Emeric and Lucie watch the whole scene between the brothers and Noah but they hide as they hear Alaric approaching.,they,"0: Emeric and Lucie, 1: the brothers and Noah, 2: Neither","The pronoun ""they"" in this sentence refers to Emeric and Lucie. The sentence structure clearly indicates that Emeric and Lucie are the subjects performing the actions of watching and hiding. The phrase ""they hide as they hear Alaric approaching"" directly follows the mention of Emeric and Lucie, indicating that ""they"" refers to these two characters. The brothers and Noah are mentioned as part of the scene being watched, not as the ones doing the watching or hiding.",0,0
2101,Katherine knew where Simone was but she did not care to find her.,she,"0: Katherine, 1: Simone, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, let's analyze the sentence:

""Katherine knew where Simone was but she did not care to find her.""

The pronoun ""she"" is used in the second part of the sentence, ""she did not care to find her."" This implies that ""she"" is referring to the person who knows where the other person is, but doesn't care to find them.

In this case, Katherine is the one who knows where Simone is, as stated in the first part of the sentence. Therefore, it's logical to conclude that ""she"" refers to Katherine, who doesn't care to find Simone.

The pronoun ""her"" at the end of the sentence likely refers to Simone, further supporting that ""she"" is Katherine.",0,0
2102,Jade tries to go on another date with Olivia but she tells her she is still preoccupied by her last relationship.,she,"0: Jade, 1: Olivia, 2: Neither","In this sentence, there are two instances of 'she' that we need to consider. Let's break it down:

1. The first 'she' in 'she tells her' refers to Olivia. This is because Jade is trying to go on a date with Olivia, and Olivia is the one responding to this attempt.

2. The second 'she' in 'she is still preoccupied' also refers to Olivia. This is because it's Olivia who is expressing that she's preoccupied with her last relationship.

The pronoun 'she' in both cases refers to Olivia, not Jade. Olivia is the one doing the telling and being preoccupied.",1,1
2103,"Hermione goes to visit Gloria, but she finds her missing and her husband viciously decapitated and runs home to arm herself.",her,"0: Hermione, 1: Gloria, 2: Neither","Let's analyze this sentence step by step:

1. ""Hermione goes to visit Gloria"" - This sets up the two main characters.
2. ""but she finds her missing"" - Here, ""she"" refers to Hermione (the subject of the sentence), and ""her"" refers to Gloria (the person being visited).
3. ""and her husband viciously decapitated"" - This ""her"" is the key pronoun we're focusing on.

The pronoun ""her"" in this context is most likely referring to Gloria for the following reasons:
- It's more logical that Gloria's husband would be in Gloria's house, not Hermione's.
- The sentence is about Hermione visiting Gloria's place and finding unexpected situations there.
- It would be unusual to suddenly introduce Hermione's husband without any prior context.

Therefore, ""her husband"" is most likely Gloria's husband.",1,1
2104,"Hindu leader said that if Vincent is guilty, then he should be punished.",he,"0: Vincent, 1: Hindu leader, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Vincent for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure suggests that Vincent is the main subject being discussed.
2. The conditional statement ""if Vincent is guilty"" is followed by ""then he should be punished,"" where ""he"" naturally refers back to Vincent.
3. It would be unusual for the Hindu leader to refer to himself in the third person in this context.
4. The sentence is reporting what the Hindu leader said about Vincent, so it makes more sense for ""he"" to refer to Vincent rather than the Hindu leader.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Vincent (candidate 0).",0,0
2105,"Berke supported Ariq Bke because he was resentful of Hulagu, who had close ties with Kublai.",he,"0: Berke, 1: Ariq Bke, 2: Neither","To determine who the pronoun ""he"" refers to, we need to analyze the context and logical flow of the sentence:

1. The sentence states that ""Berke supported Ariq Bke because he was resentful of Hulagu.""
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used to explain the reason for the support.
3. It's more logical that the person providing support (Berke) would have a reason for doing so, rather than the person being supported (Ariq Bke).
4. The resentment towards Hulagu is presented as the motivation for the support.
5. Therefore, it makes more sense that Berke was the one resentful of Hulagu, which led him to support Ariq Bke.

Based on this reasoning, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Berke.",0,0
2106,"Thomas O'Hara Croswell was apprenticed to the law school founder Tapping Reeve, though he later became a physician.",he,"0: the law school founder Tapping Reeve, 1: Thomas O'Hara Croswell, 2: Neither","The pronoun ""he"" in this sentence refers to Thomas O'Hara Croswell for the following reasons:

1. The sentence structure indicates that Thomas O'Hara Croswell is the main subject of the sentence.
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the latter part of the sentence to continue discussing the actions of the main subject.
3. The sentence describes Thomas O'Hara Croswell's career progression, from being apprenticed to becoming a physician, which logically connects to the use of ""he"" in describing this transition.
4. Tapping Reeve is mentioned only as a secondary figure (the founder of the law school where Croswell was apprenticed) and not as the main subject of the sentence's action.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Thomas O'Hara Croswell.",1,1
2107,Sara is instantly attracted to Kim but because she is engaged to Shin she stops the two from going past a platonic friendship.,she,"0: Sara, 1: Kim, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""she"" refers to, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context:

1. The sentence starts with ""Sara is instantly attracted to Kim"".
2. Then it says ""but because she is engaged to Shin"".
3. The pronoun ""she"" is used in reference to someone who is engaged to Shin.

Given this information, we can deduce that ""she"" refers to Sara for the following reasons:
- Sara is the subject of the first part of the sentence, making her the most likely antecedent for the pronoun.
- The sentence structure suggests that the person who is attracted (Sara) is the same person who is engaged, creating a conflict or reason to stop the relationship from progressing.
- It would be less logical for Kim to be engaged to Shin in this context, as the sentence is primarily about Sara's actions and feelings.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Sara.",0,0
2108,"Meanwhile, Caroline tries to keep Audrey busy so she wo n't go out searching for Elena.",she,"0: Audrey, 1: Caroline, 2: Neither","In this sentence, we need to determine who ""she"" refers to. Let's analyze the context:

1. Caroline is the subject of the sentence, performing the action of trying to keep Audrey busy.
2. The purpose of Caroline's action is to prevent someone from going out to search for Elena.
3. Logically, the person who might go out searching for Elena is more likely to be Audrey, not Caroline (who is actively trying to prevent this).
4. Therefore, ""she"" in this context refers to Audrey, as Caroline is trying to keep Audrey busy to prevent Audrey from going out to search for Elena.

Based on this reasoning, the pronoun ""she"" refers to Audrey.",0,0
2109,"Bonnie tries to call Lorane, but she is not answering.",she,"0: Bonnie, 1: Lorane, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Lorane. The context suggests that Bonnie is trying to call Lorane, but Lorane is not answering. It's more logical to assume that the person being called (Lorane) is the one not answering, rather than the person making the call (Bonnie). Therefore, ""she"" in this case refers to Lorane.",1,1
2110,"Helene plans on killing Anna since she knows too much, but suddenly gets caught by the Blue Demon and eaten offscreen.",she,"0: Helene, 1: Anna, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""she"" most likely refers to Anna. The reasoning is as follows:

1. The sentence structure suggests that ""she"" is the object of Helene's planned action, not the subject.
2. The phrase ""she knows too much"" implies that Anna is the one with the knowledge that Helene considers dangerous.
3. It makes more logical sense for Helene to want to kill Anna because Anna knows too much, rather than Helene wanting to kill Anna because Helene herself knows too much.

Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" in this context refers to Anna (candidate 1).",1,1
2111,"Although Tommasini makes no mention of Bernstein until well into the article, he draws continuously and heavily on the Norton Lectures.",he,"0: Tommasini, 1: Bernstein, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" clearly refers to Tommasini. The sentence is describing Tommasini's actions in writing the article, stating that he (Tommasini) draws on the Norton Lectures despite not mentioning Bernstein until later in the article. The subject of the sentence is Tommasini, and ""he"" is used to refer back to this subject in the second part of the sentence.",1,0
2112,Walter is not impressed by Jesse but his old friend and CEO Guy hires him.,his,"0: Walter, 1: Jesse, 2: Neither","To determine who ""his"" refers to in this sentence, we need to analyze the context and grammatical structure:

1. The sentence mentions Walter, Jesse, and Guy.
2. ""his"" is used to describe an ""old friend and CEO"" named Guy.
3. The pronoun ""his"" is more likely to refer to Walter than Jesse because:
   a. Walter is mentioned first in the sentence, making him the primary subject.
   b. The structure ""Walter is not impressed by Jesse but his..."" suggests a contrast between Walter's opinion of Jesse and Walter's relationship with Guy.
   c. It's more plausible that Walter, being older and more experienced, would have an ""old friend"" who is a CEO.

Therefore, ""his"" most likely refers to Walter.",1,0
2113,"The tired and hungry Shan Xiongxin was easily defeated by Liang Shitai, so he was not invited by the host.",he,"0: The tired and hungry Shan Xiongxin, 1: Liang Shitai, 2: Neither","To determine which candidate the pronoun ""he"" refers to, let's analyze the sentence:

1. The sentence describes two people: Shan Xiongxin and Liang Shitai.
2. Shan Xiongxin is described as ""tired and hungry"" and was ""easily defeated.""
3. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the clause ""he was not invited by the host.""
4. Logically, the person who was not invited would be the one who was defeated, as it's common for hosts to invite winners rather than losers.
5. Therefore, ""he"" most likely refers to Shan Xiongxin, who was defeated and consequently not invited.

The pronoun ""he"" refers to Shan Xiongxin, who is candidate 0.",0,0
2114,"Li Shimin was very sad after knowing the death of Yuchi Jinde, so he put off the time to execute Xue Rengui and re-try the case.",he,"0: Yuchi Jinde, 1: Li Shimin, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Li Shimin. The reasoning is as follows:

1. The sentence starts by mentioning Li Shimin's emotional state: ""Li Shimin was very sad...""
2. The pronoun ""he"" is used in the latter part of the sentence to describe actions taken: ""...he put off the time to execute Xue Rengui and re-try the case.""
3. These actions (postponing an execution and re-trying a case) are typically performed by someone in a position of authority, which aligns with Li Shimin's role as an important figure.
4. Yuchi Jinde is mentioned as having died, so the pronoun cannot refer to him.

Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to Li Shimin.",1,1
2115,"Natacha finally attacks Norah after closing time in the empty nightclub and violently rapes her, but does not kill her.",her,"0: Natacha, 1: Norah, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""her"" is used twice. Let's analyze each occurrence:

1. ""...violently rapes her"": In this context, ""her"" clearly refers to Norah. Natacha is the subject performing the action (attacking and raping), while Norah is the object receiving the action.

2. ""...but does not kill her"": Again, this ""her"" refers to Norah. It's a continuation of the previous action, indicating that Natacha didn't kill Norah after raping her.

Both instances of ""her"" in this sentence refer to Norah, not Natacha. The pronoun is used to avoid repeating Norah's name and to clearly indicate that she is the victim of Natacha's actions.",1,1
2116,"Scott had the support of the powerful Lord Melville, but by the time he began his canvassing Wedderburn was too far ahead to be dislodged.",he,"0: Scott, 1: the powerful Lord Melville, 2: Neither","In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" refers to Scott. The context indicates that Scott is the one who began canvassing, which is a political activity typically done by candidates. The sentence structure suggests that Scott is the main subject, and ""he"" is used to refer back to Scott in the latter part of the sentence. Lord Melville is mentioned as supporting Scott, but is not the one performing the action of canvassing.",0,0
